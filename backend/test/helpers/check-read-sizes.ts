/**
 * What every static check reads, recorded — and the band that ratchets it
 * (issue #244).
 *
 * ## Why a number per check
 *
 * Seven times a check has reported `violations=0` because it was not looking:
 * a walk that came back short (#215), a population definition that excluded a
 * live entry point (#228), a file that hid a site (#235, #237), a spread that
 * bypassed excess-property checking (#238), an input transform that ate 41% of
 * the file (#241), and a population defined by the presence of the very thing
 * being checked (#244). Each was repaired where it was found. The common cause
 * was never repaired: **a check's output said what it found and never said what
 * it read**, so "found nothing" and "read nothing" printed the same green.
 *
 * Every check now prints a read line — `scripts/lib/read-size.ts` for the
 * twenty-four tsx ones, `scripts/lib/read-size.sh` for the three shell ones —
 * and this file is what makes that number *bite*: it records what each check
 * reads on the current tree, and `test/unit/scripts/check-read-size.test.ts`
 * spawns each check and compares.
 *
 * ## The band, and why it is not exact
 *
 * A tree gains and loses files constantly, so an exact-match ratchet is noise
 * and a symmetric ±50% catches nothing. The band is therefore **asymmetric**,
 * because its two edges answer different questions:
 *
 *   * **Lower edge, −10%.** This is the defect direction and the one that
 *     matters. Measured against what the family actually does: moving
 *     `src/modules` out removes 93% of the files a module walk reads; a glob
 *     that stops matching a subtree removes tens of percent. Downward drift
 *     from ordinary work is far smaller — over the last 60 days of `master` the
 *     backend source count never fell, and deleting a whole module (~20 files)
 *     is 1.4% of a 1459-file walk. −10% therefore sits well above the noise and
 *     well below every shape in the family. Per-module loss, which is finer
 *     than any percentage, is caught by the `sources=` reconciliation instead.
 *   * **Upper edge, +50%.** This edge catches nothing defective; it exists so a
 *     recorded number cannot quietly become decorative. It has to clear
 *     ordinary growth, and growth here is fast: `backend/src/**.ts` went
 *     1348 → 1483 in the week this was written (+10%), and 1021 → 1483 in the
 *     month (+45%), because feature 072 is converting 65 modules. A tighter
 *     ceiling would fail weekly on correct MRs and be raised without being
 *     read, which is how a ratchet dies. +50% asks for a re-record roughly
 *     every five weeks at that rate, in the MR that grew the tree.
 *
 * Small populations get {@link READ_SIZE_SLACK} absolute units instead of a
 * percentage: six generated artefacts and seven citing documents cannot move by
 * 10% of themselves, and a band that rounds to zero would fail on the seventh
 * artefact arriving.
 *
 * **Never widen the band to make a run pass.** Re-record the number, in the
 * merge request that changed the population, and say what changed it.
