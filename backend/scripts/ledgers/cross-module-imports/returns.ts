/**
 * Cross-module reaches still standing in `returns` (feature 075,
 * FR-022…FR-026; feature 091, FR-017).
 *
 * Keyed `<file>:<target module>/<target path>` for an import and
 * `<file>:sql:<owner>/<table>` for a raw statement or a query builder, so moving code
 * inside a file does not invalidate an entry. The file is spelled as `layout.keyOf`
 * spells it — repository-relative for an admin surface, which has no `backend/src` of
 * the application's to be relative to.
 *
 * Two-way: an unledgered reach fails the build, and an entry that no longer describes one
 * fails it too. Delete this file when the last entry goes; an empty shard is refused,
 * because a done signal that says nothing is not one.
 *
 * **Every entry here is an admin surface reach**, recorded by feature 091 Phase 0 before
 * any admin directory moves into its module's package. What retires one is never the move
 * and never a rewritten specifier: it is the owner publishing what this consumer needs —
 * into `@endora-commerce/admin-kit` where the piece is generic, or as an admin
 * contribution zone where it is the owner's own screen (`spec.md` FR-006, FR-007).
