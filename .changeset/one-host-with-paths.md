Endora Commerce can be served from **one host with paths** — the storefront at `/`, the admin under `/admin`, the API under `/api` — as well as from one address per component.

`@endora-commerce/cli`

- **`endora install --public-url <origin>`** selects that layout. It stands for `--api-url <origin>`, `--storefront-url <origin>` and `--admin-url <origin>/admin`, each applied where the run has a use for it (so it works with `--only` on each machine in turn), and is refused beside any of the three. The API's address in this layout is the host itself — its routes already begin with `/api/v1` — so `--api-url` and `--storefront-url` still refuse a path, and now say why.
- **`--admin-url` accepts a base path** after its origin (`https://example.com/admin`, or any other plain path; no trailing slash, query or fragment) and is accepted by a run that stands the admin up without the API, where it used to be refused. The path is written as `ADMIN_BASE_PATH=<path>/` into `admin/.env`.
- **The scaffolded `admin/vite.config.ts` reads `ADMIN_BASE_PATH` as Vite's `base`** (default `/`). An instance scaffolded before this release gets the same by adding `base: env['ADMIN_BASE_PATH'] || '/'` to its own configuration.
- With the API in the run, `ADMIN_BASE_URL` is the admin's whole address, path included, and `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` holds origins, each once. A port in an origin two components share is the proxy's, and is no longer written as either component's `PORT`.
- The wizard, for a run that stands up only some components, asks how the three are reached before it asks any address: *one address each*, or *one address, with paths* — which is then one question.
- The closing block of such a run lists the routing the host owes: `/api/` and `/assets/file/` to the API unchanged, `/api/revalidate` exactly to the storefront, `/admin/` to the admin with its `index.html` as the fallback, everything else to the storefront.
- **`deploy/nginx.paths.example.conf`** (single-host topology) is that routing for nginx, and `deploy/README.md` gains a section on it. `Dockerfile.admin` says how the image is built for a base path: a committed `admin/.env.production` holding `ADMIN_BASE_PATH=/admin/`.
- **Both nginx examples forward `$http_host`** — the host with its port — as `Host` and `X-Forwarded-Host`, where they forwarded `$host`. Behind a proxy on any port but 80 or 443 the storefront refused every form submission (`x-forwarded-host … does not match origin`), because Next compares the two.
- The storefront this CLI carries: its service worker leaves requests under `/admin` to the network, as it leaves `/api/`.

`@endora-commerce/admin-shell`

- **`AdminRoot` mounts its router under the bundle's base path.** New optional prop `basename`; by default it is derived from Vite's `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`, so a project built with `base: '/admin/'` gets a router under `/admin` with nothing else to set. With the default base nothing changes. New export `routerBasename(base)`.

`@endora-commerce/mod-blog`, `@endora-commerce/mod-catalog`

- Two admin screens linked with a raw absolute `href` (the *new category* button of the blog category tree; the product links in the bulk-edit result list). Under a base path a raw `href` leaves the admin, and at the root it reloaded the application; both are the router's `Link` now.
