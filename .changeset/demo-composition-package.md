`demo seed` on an instance scaffolded by the CLI now builds a working demo shop. Before, it created every module's own demo rows and nothing that joins them: `admin@demo.local` and both sales representatives had no admin role (`/admin/me` answered `permissions: []`, so the admin sidebar was empty), and the 203 demo products were sold on no sales channel, so the storefront listed none. The wiring — roles, channel and category bindings, the menu, prices, stock, the demo buyer, attributes, images, attachments and the credit limit — was a file in the platform repository's own host, which no instance had.

It is now the new package `@endora-commerce/demo-composition`. The platform's operator CLI finds an installed package declaring `"endora": { "type": "demo-composition" }` when the instance's `cli.ts` passes no `demoComposition` loader, and runs it; with none installed, `demo seed` behaves as before and its notice now names the package to add. `endora install --demo` and the new `endora new instance --demo` add the package to the instance's module list and write no file into the tree.

The demo adopts the instance's system-default sales channel as its retail channel and keeps that channel's code when the operator chose one (`DEFAULT_SALES_CHANNEL_CODE`); only the platform's fallback code, `default`, is renamed `pl_retail`, as before. It used to rename any code, which would have moved the demo off the channel a storefront is built against.

To fix an existing instance: `pnpm add @endora-commerce/demo-composition`, then `pnpm run cli demo seed` again. The seed is idempotent, so the rows already there are joined rather than duplicated.
