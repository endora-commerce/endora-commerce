# Endora Commerce (b2b-platform) — Agent Instructions

Last updated: 2026-08-10

**This file is the single source of truth for every AI coding agent working in this
repository.** `CLAUDE.md` and `.cursor/rules/specify-rules.mdc` are thin pointers to it —
put shared knowledge here, never in a pointer. Cursor, Codex, Amp and other AGENTS.md-aware
tools read this file directly; Claude Code reaches it through the `@AGENTS.md` import in
`CLAUDE.md`.

## Stack

- **`backend/`** — TypeScript 5.x strict on Node.js ≥ 22.17. Fastify, MikroORM (PostgreSQL),
  Zod, ioredis, BullMQ, Meilisearch, `nodemailer`, `pdfmake`. Cross-cutting infrastructure:
  in-process `EventBus` (`src/events/bus.ts`), Command Bus (`src/commands/`), TenantContext
  (`src/tenancy/`), module lifecycle (`src/modules/_lifecycle/`), i18n (`src/modules/_i18n/`).
- **`admin/`** — React 19 + Vite + react-router-dom 7 + `@b2b/api-client` + `lucide-react` +
  Tailwind 4 + Radix/shadcn primitives; `@measured/puck` for the CMS/e-mail builders;
  `@dnd-kit` for drag-drop; charts through the `<EChart>` wrapper
  (`admin/src/components/charts/echart.tsx`).
- **`storefront/`** — Next.js 15 App Router + React 19 + Tailwind v4, Server Components and
  server actions.
- **`packages/`** — `contracts` (Zod schemas: the source of truth for every API shape),
  `api-client`, `cms-components`, `email-components`.

**A new runtime dependency needs written justification** in the feature plan's Complexity
Tracking section (Constitution IV). The default answer is "no new dependency" — reuse what
is already in the stack.

## Binding principles

Full text in `.specify/memory/constitution.md` — this is the working summary, not a
replacement. Non-negotiable ones are marked **(NN)**.

- **I. Modular architecture (NN)** — a module owns its entities, services, routes,
  migrations, i18n and tests. Cross-module interaction goes through exported services or the
  `EventBus`; never import another module's internals. Design every module so it can be
  detached.
- **II. API-first** — define the shape as a Zod schema in `packages/contracts/` first;
  breaking changes are versioned.
- **III. TDD (NN)** — failing test first, then implementation. Every functional requirement
  traces to a test.
- **IV. YAGNI & minimal dependencies** — see the Stack note above.
- **V. TypeScript everywhere** / **VI. Naming conventions (NN)** / **VIII. English-only
  working language (NN)**.
- **VII. SEO, performance & discoverability** — storefront pages stay SSR/SSG-capable.
- **IX. UI reuse** — reuse the admin design system and existing primitives before adding new
  ones.
- **X. Scalable queue consumers** — long-running or repeatable work follows the existing
  BullMQ worker pattern (e.g. `quote_requests/rfq-expiry-worker.ts`).
- **XI. Multi-tenant isolation (NN)** — the Organization is the one tenant concept; every
  transacting customer has one (B2C gets a personal org). Tenant-scoped entities pass through
  the global-filter guard in `backend/src/tenancy/`. A design with a "no-organization" path
  is invalid.
- **XII. Sales-channel content scoping (NN)** — channel-scoped reads go through the resolved
  request channel and the sanctioned bridge accessors, not hand-rolled queries.
- **XIII. Uniform write auditing via Command Bus (NN)** — admin/domain writes run through
  `CommandBus.run` so auditing and undo stay uniform.
- **XIV. Entity-agnostic extensibility** — runtime custom fields instead of bespoke columns
  where the requirement is "add a field".
- **XV. Untouched core & per-deployment overlay** — see "Overlay modules" below.
- **XVI. Module discoverability in the command palette** — see the checklist below.
- **XVII. Operator-toggleable modules (NN)** — presence is the conjunction of **two
  orthogonal axes**: platform availability (lifecycle registry, deployment-owned, CLI) and
  operator activation (a manifest-declared Setting, flipped on the kernel-served
  `/platform/modules` screen — a surface no module owns — business-owned, Admin UI). Neither
  overwrites the other. A module that is off behaves as if never
  installed — business logic, API, Admin UI and Storefront — its own activation control
  being the one exception. Off is non-destructive and reversible; non-deactivatable modules
  declare that in their manifest; dependencies fail closed. See the checklist below.

## Required checklists for a new backend module

### Composition — `backend.ts` (feature 072)

**A module is composed by the kernel container, not by a composition root.** All 65 core
modules export `registerModule(ctx: ModuleContext): void` from `backend/src/modules/<id>/backend.ts`;
`backend/src/composition.ts` and `backend/test/test-server.ts` compose that list and pass
deployment inputs, nothing more. Never construct a module's services in either root, and
never add a "module options" object for something the module can read itself.

1. **Own services** — `ctx.di.register({ name: ctx.asFunction(…).singleton() })`. The key is
   claimed: a second writer gets `DuplicateRegistrationError`.
2. **Ports you own** — `ctx.di.providePort('<name>', …)` for anything another module resolves.
   It wraps the registration in a transient gate on the module's effective state, so a caller
   gets the 503 `MODULE_DISABLED` envelope instead of a half-executed operation (Principle XVII).
3. **Reading someone else's port** — `lazyPort<T>(ctx, 'literalPortName')`. **Never resolve a
   port into a singleton**: Awilix strict mode refuses the capture, and it is right to — a
   captured gate keeps answering after its owner is switched off. The name must be a **string
   literal**, or `check-port-dependencies.ts` cannot see the edge (a `port(ctx, name)` helper
   once hid fourteen resolutions, several registered by nobody, while the check read clean).
   **`T` is a contract type from `packages/contracts/`, never the provider's class** — and not
   a `Pick<>` / `ReturnType<>` / `InstanceType<>` over it either, since each of those imports
   the class. A module may not name a file in another module's directory in any specifier
   shape, `import type` included; `check:module-boundary` is the ratchet, and the 674 edges
   standing when it landed are ledgered per consumer module under
   `backend/scripts/ledgers/cross-module-imports/` while feature 075 drains them.
4. **Declare the edge** — resolving a port owned by `X` puts `X` in your manifest
   `dependencies`. That is what makes the edge real to the lifecycle, the migration order and
   an operator switching `X` off. The port check fails the build without it.
4a. **Say what happens when `X` is off.** `check-port-dependencies.ts` also builds the
   **deactivation-consequence ledger** (feature 074): every cross-module edge into a
   switchable module answers one of four ways — it fails closed at the seam, it degrades as
   your `nonBindingDependencies` entry declares, it is a boot-time contribution the host
   filters, or it is schema-only. An edge that answers none fails the build, and the three
   shapes that do are all fail-*open*: a captured cross-module registration, a read of an
   ungated registry whose owner states no absent-owner policy, and a gated port resolved
   before the first request. The same artefact is what the operator's confirmation dialog
   renders, so the classification is not CI bookkeeping — see
   `docs/docs/architecture/kernel.md` § *The deactivation-consequence ledger*.
5. **Routes, workers, subscribers** — `ctx.routes` / `ctx.worker` / `ctx.subscribe`. These
   already apply the gating wrappers; do not call `defineModuleRoutes` and friends by hand.
6. **Settings your module owns** — read them through `settingsReadPort` inside the module.
   A knob a root resolves on the module's behalf is a knob that drifts between the two roots,
   and repeatedly did.
7. **Never wrap a port call in a bare `catch`** — it swallows `ModuleDisabledError` and turns
   fail-closed into fail-open. Where a degrade genuinely belongs, put it inside the owner's
   implementation and express it in the return type
   (`allowedIdsFor(): Promise<string[] | null>` is the worked example). Where a **narrow**
   tolerance is genuinely correct — a per-item import failure, a compensating cleanup — keep
   the `catch` and make `rethrowIfModuleDisabled(error)` its first line, with a comment saying
   why the tolerance is right; "defensive" is not a reason. Enforced by
   `pnpm --filter backend run check:port-catches`, which also refuses a *conditional*
   re-throw: `ModuleDisabledError` is an `HttpError`, so a status-code test lets it through by
   accident rather than by decision. It follows the port **through the value**, not the
   `lazyPort` literal (issues #133/#113): a `catch` around a holder the port was constructed
   into, or around a name a composition root contributed, is the same violation. Run it with
   `PORT_CATCH_WHY=1` to see why a name reads as a port. A site whose **every** gate belongs to
   a module the platform refuses to switch off is reported as `OWNER LOCKED` instead: the
   presence answer is unreachable, so there is nothing to drain and a ledger entry over one
   reads stale (D-63). That classification is derived from the manifests on every run, never
   written into a reason — un-lock the owner and the site is a violation again, in the same run.
8. **One registration pass, one boot phase (D-45).** A root calls `composeModules(MODULES, …)`
   once and `runBootHooks()` once, immediately before it builds the Fastify app — so **a boot
   hook may resolve anything**, whichever module registered it. Registration itself resolves
   nothing (`compose.ts`'s `registering` guard), which is what makes its order meaningless.
   The one ordering rule left is for the **root**: a contribution over a name a module
   defaults goes in the single slot between `composeModules(MODULES, …)` and `runBootHooks()`
   — earlier and the module's default overwrites it, later and a boot hook has already read
   that default. **That slot is a method** (issue #52): write
   `composedModules.contribute({ name: value })`, never `registerValues(container, …)` after
   the compose call. The early edge is then structural — there is no object to call it on
   until every module has registered — and the late edge throws
   `ContributionWindowClosedError`. `registerValues` stays legal *above* the compose call, for
   a host value no module defaults (`redis`, `eventBus`, the `*RunWorkers` flags): there is no
   window because there is nothing to overwrite.
9. **Install-time work goes in `manifest.ts`, never in the context.** `ctx.onBoot` is the
   only lifecycle hook a `ModuleContext` carries; `ctx.onInstall` / `ctx.onUninstall` were
   deleted (D-46) because `module:install` composes nothing, so a hook the container
   collected could never fire. Export `installHook` / `uninstallHook` from the module's
   `manifest.ts` — the composer generator wires them. Their contract, in full: the hook is
   **idempotent by contract** (it re-runs after a failed install and after a
   soft-uninstall → install cycle); a **failing install hook aborts the install** and reverts
   that run's migrations; a **failing uninstall hook removes nothing**; **`ctx.hard`**
   discriminates soft from destructive uninstall, so cleanup sits behind
   `if (!ctx.hard) return;`; **neither hook fires on activation or deactivation** — that is
   the other axis (Principle XVII) and no hook may be added to it; and the hook context is
   `{ em, redis, log, module }` (`+ hard`), which cannot carry services.
10. **The platform roots may not import a module (D-52/D-53).** `src/kernel`, `src/http`,
   `src/events` and `src/tenancy` are one rule, not one plus three peers: the kernel does not
   compile without them (five kernel entities take `@GlobalEntity()` from `src/tenancy`, four
   kernel files take `HttpError` from `src/http` as a value), so a peer allowed to name
   `src/modules/` or `src/apps/` is a kernel importing modules with one extra hop. A platform
   file that needs something a module owns takes it **by injection from a composition root**
   — the pattern `ErrorEnvelopeOptions` uses. `src/db`, `src/overlay` and `src/commands` are
   not platform roots.
11. **CI** — `pnpm --filter backend run check:port-dependencies`, `check:port-catches`,
   `check:kernel-boundary`, `check:module-boundary`, `check:container-imports`,
   `check:subscribe-seam`, `check:entry-presence`, and
   `pnpm --filter backend exec vitest run test/contract/kernel/harness-parity.test.ts`
   (drift between the two composition roots, as an explicit draining ledger).

Full guide, including the contribution-point rules and the request scope:
`docs/docs/architecture/kernel.md`.

### Admin permissions

Every module with routes gated by `requireAdmin(...)` **must** register its permission codes
so they appear on `/admin-roles` and pass the CI inventory.

1. **`manifest.ts`** — `permissions: [{ code, label, module? }]` for every code this module owns.
2. **`manifest-index.generated.ts`** — **generated** (feature 072): a module that ships a
   lifecycle-shape `manifest.ts` is picked up by the tree walk. Run
   `pnpm --filter backend run composer:generate` and commit the result; never edit the file.
   It is the only generated manifest registry (feature 071, F2) — `registered-manifests.ts`
   derives `REGISTERED_MANIFESTS` from it, and the deployment-resolved set on top of that.
3. **Routes** — `requireAdmin('…')` literals must match manifest `code` values exactly.
   The inventory scanner reads the call in every shape the tree writes it (bare,
   through `deps.`/a cradle, optional-call, `requireAdminAny([…])`, a constant or a
   permission-map member, and a `hasPermission` capability check), and **fails on an
   argument it cannot resolve** rather than skipping it. Write the code as a literal or
   a resolvable constant; do not compute it.
4. **i18n** — `adminRoles.permission.<code>` in `_i18n/i18n/en.json` and `pl.json`.
5. **AppShell** — `requiredPermission` on nav entries where applicable.
6. **CI** — `pnpm --filter backend exec vitest run test/contract/admin_users/permission-inventory.test.ts`
   before opening the MR. It sweeps **both** directions — enforced ⇒ grantable and
   grantable ⇒ enforced — plus the label coverage, so a permission declared before its
   gate lands fails just as loudly as one gated before it is declared.

Do not duplicate shared codes from core `PERMISSION_CATALOGUE`
(`packages/contracts/src/admin.ts`). Contract:
`specs/026-admin-roles-permissions/contracts/module-manifest-permissions.md`.

### Command palette (Principle XVI)

Every module with an admin surface **must** be discoverable under ⌘K / CTRL+K. Sidebar-only
is not enough.

1. **`manifest.ts`** — `actions: [{ id, labelKey, descriptionKey, icon, targetRoute,
   requiredPermission, keywords, weight }]` for the module's landing surface plus its few
   highest-value operator actions. Curate — this is a discovery surface, not a route dump.
2. **`requiredPermission`** — the code gating the target surface, so the palette never
   advertises a 403.
3. **i18n** — `labelKey` / `descriptionKey` are **relative to the module namespace**
   (`actions.openX.label`, not `<module>.actions.openX.label`) and live in the module's own
   `i18n/en.json` + `pl.json`. Those files must be a **flat** `{"a.b.c": "text"}` map — a
   nested object fails `TranslationBundleEntriesSchema`, the boot reconciler only logs and
   skips it, and the palette silently renders raw keys.
4. **`icon`** — must be in `KnownIconNameSchema` (`packages/contracts/src/admin-actions.ts`);
   adding a name there requires the matching entry in
   `admin/src/lib/admin-actions/icon-map.ts` in the same MR.
5. **`targetRoute`** — a real admin route (no query string; the route regex rejects one).
   Deep-link actions need an actual route, e.g. `/credentials/new`.
6. **CI** — `pnpm --filter backend exec vitest run test/unit/_i18n/registered-bundles-shape.test.ts`
   verifies that every registered module's on-disk bundles load and that every manifest action
   key resolves in every shipped language.

### Module enable/disable (Principle XVII)

A module's presence is the **conjunction of two orthogonal axes** — do not conflate them:

| Axis | Stored in | Owned by | Changed via | Answers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Platform availability** | lifecycle registry (`module_registrations`) | deployment operator | CLI / deployment tooling | is this module installed and wired here? |
| **Operator activation** | a manifest-declared Setting in the settings store | business operator | Admin UI, on `/platform/modules` | does this client want this capability? |

Effective presence = **both true**. Gate on the effective state, fail closed if either is off.
An activation write must not touch the registry, and a platform disable → enable cycle must
preserve the operator's activation choice.

The gating wrappers exist in `backend/src/kernel/lifecycle/` (`defineModuleRoutes`,
`defineModuleWorker`, `subscribeForModule`, `requireModuleEnabled`) — extend them to the
effective state rather than adding a parallel check. They live in the kernel, alongside the
registry cache, the activation resolver and the effective-state combiner, because the kernel
applies them to every module it composes and may not import from `src/modules/` (D-37).
`_lifecycle` keeps the operator-facing half: the manifest, the permissions, the routes, the
Commands, the orchestrator and the `module:*` CLI scripts.

**You almost never call those wrappers yourself.** All 65 core modules are composed through
the kernel container (feature 072), and `ctx.routes` / `ctx.worker` / `ctx.subscribe` apply
the wrappers for you — see the composition checklist above. Call them directly only where
there is no `ModuleContext`: a CLI entry point, or an overlay module under
`backend/src/apps/<deployment>/modules/`, which is still composed through the feature-057
`overlayModule` factory. Four core modules (`newsletter`, `product_feeds`, `pim_ergonode`,
`ksef`) still wrap a second time inside their `plugin.ts`; that is conversion residue, not a
pattern to copy.

1. **Routes** — wrap the module's route registration in `defineModuleRoutes('<id>', …)` so
   gating holds at the registration seam for every route the module owns, including later
   ones. Never gate per handler.
2. **Workers and subscribers** — register BullMQ workers through `defineModuleWorker` and
   EventBus subscriptions through `subscribeForModule`, so both stop when the module is off.
   In a composed module that means `ctx.worker` / `ctx.subscribe`, and the subscription is
   registered from `backend.ts` — a handler kept in a service is fine, a **registration**
   kept in a plugin body is what produced twenty-two ungated subscribers (issue #107).
   `pnpm --filter backend run check:subscribe-seam` fails the build on a bare `eventBus.on`
   in a module, against an empty two-way ledger.
3. **Cross-module calls** — the gate is the **port registration**, not a call you write.
   `ctx.di.providePort('<name>', …)` wraps the registration in a transient gate on the owner's
   effective state, so a consumer resolving it through `lazyPort` gets the 503 `MODULE_DISABLED`
   envelope at the call site instead of a half-executed operation. That is the whole instruction for
   an entry point another module can reach: **publish it as a port and declare the edge** (composition
   checklist items 2–4). A gate the registration applies cannot be forgotten in the one service
   somebody adds later, which a hand-placed call can and did.

   `requireModuleEnabled('<id>')` (`backend/src/kernel/lifecycle/plugin-helpers.ts:82`) is kept for
   the entry point that has **no port and no request** — a `module:*` CLI script, a one-off
   maintenance entry — and it has **zero call sites in `src/` today**; this item used to instruct
   every module author to call it, which is how it came to be cited far more often than used.
   `check-port-catches.ts` knows the spelling, so a `catch` around one is refused like a `catch`
   around a port.

   **Where nothing can catch the throw, presence is *decided* before the work — not caught after
   it.** A timer callback is the standing example: it has nowhere to throw *to*, so a
   `ModuleDisabledError` raised inside it is either swallowed by a `catch` that was meant for
   transient failures or it takes out the tick. So ask `effectiveState.isPresent('<id>')` and return
   — **first, and outside the `try`**, so a genuine failure and a switched-off module do not share
   one silent no-op. `backend/src/modules/ksef/plugin.ts:179-190` is the worked example and says so
   in its own comment. The same rule holds for any entry point with no caller to answer: a boot hook,
   a signal handler, a `process.on` sweep.

   `pnpm --filter backend run check:entry-presence` is the ratchet (issues #126 and #146), and it
   sees **less than the rule says**: a `setInterval`, a `setTimeout` the callback re-arms, a
   `process.on` lifecycle handler and a `ctx.onBoot` hook, each in a module's own sources. It does
   not see a one-shot deadline inside an operation that already has a caller, a synchronous write
   reached through an imported helper, or a boot hook that awaits nothing.
   `TIMERS_WITHOUT_PRESENCE` and `BOOT_HOOKS_WITHOUT_PRESENCE` are two-way and, unlike the subscribe
   ledger, are not expected to empty: an entry says why a site is **right** to keep running while its
   module is off.

   **A boot hook is one of those entry points, and the obligation splits three ways** (issue #146,
   D-67/D-68). This paragraph used to except boot hooks on the grounds that "`runBootHooks` catches,
   so that is one kernel decision rather than a guard per module". It does not catch: it wraps the
   hook, attributes the failure to the module and **re-throws** as `ModuleCompositionError`, which
   `index.ts` turns into `process.exit(1)` — and that is the ruled-correct behaviour, because a boot
   hook runs during composition, where a swallowed failure would mean serving requests on a platform
   that is not what the code says it is. So the obligation is per hook: a hook that
   **does work** (a reconcile, a seed, a Redis or Postgres write) probes
   `effectiveState.isPresent('<own id>')` first and returns, exactly like a timer; a hook that
   **contributes** an inert descriptor to another module's registry must **not** probe, because the
   host filters by contributor at enumeration and a probe would make runtime activation require a
   restart; and a hook that does **both is split in two before either answer applies** — probing a
   mixed hook stops the contribution, which for `blog` and `cms` meant an operator could delete an
   asset a switched-off module's rows still embed. `blog`, `cms` and `product_feeds` all ship the
   split shape, a work hook and a contribution hook kept separate, each with the reason in its own
   comment. A module that declares `activation.nonDeactivatable` is exempt: it has no absent state
   for a hook to run in, and the check derives that from the manifest rather than a list.
4. **Manifest** — declare the module's activation control and its default, and, if the
   platform genuinely cannot run without the module, declare it non-deactivatable with a
   reason. The lifecycle orchestrator refuses to disable **or uninstall** a module that
   declares it — soft and hard alike, with no `--force` (D-69) — so the declaration bites on
   both axes and on every withdrawal. Never hard-code an exception list in the
   admin app, and never declare it because a screen happens to live in the module — the
   activation controls render on `/platform/modules`, which belongs to no module (D-36).
5. **Admin and Storefront** — a module that is off contributes no sidebar entry, palette
   action, widget, tab, settings group or editable configuration, and no storefront element.
   Both frontends resolve this from the server's effective enabled-set; do not hard-code the
   surfaces. A platform-unavailable module renders as absent or blocked-with-a-reason, never
   as merely "switched off".
6. **Tests** — ship an off-state test proving API rejection, admin absence, non-editable
   configuration and storefront absence while off, plus full restoration — and cover the
   deactivated-while-platform-available case specifically.

Switching a module off is **not** uninstalling: it drops no data, configuration, bundles,
permissions or schema.

**The two therefore differ on the operator's activation choice, and the difference is
deliberate.** `disable` → `enable` is a pause: the platform row flips, nothing else moves,
and the choice comes back. A soft `uninstall` → `install` is taking the module off the
table: the settings sweep in the orchestrator runs on soft and hard alike, and the
activation control is a Setting the module owns, so a re-install starts from the manifest
default. Do not "fix" that asymmetry — it is the product's answer, and
`test/unit/_lifecycle/orchestrator.test.ts` asserts both halves so a fix fails.

### Migrations (feature 065)

There is **no repo-wide sequential migration number**. Never write "the next free `NNN_*`
number", never pick a number, never edit an execution list.

1. **Scaffold it** — `pnpm --filter backend run migration:new -- --module <id> --name <slug>`.
   The file lands in `backend/src/modules/<id>/migrations/` (or `backend/src/db/migrations/`
   for `--module core`), named `<YYYYMMDDTHHmmss>_<module-segment>_<slug>.ts` with a UTC
   timestamp. The class name is derived mechanically from the filename
   (`Migration<STAMP><PascalCaseTail>`); it is the name persisted in `mikro_orm_migrations`,
   so never rename an applied class.
2. **Register it** — run `pnpm --filter backend run composer:generate` and commit
   **`backend/src/db/migrations-registry.generated.ts`** alongside the migration. The
   registry is generated from a filesystem walk (feature 071, F2) and replaced the
   hand-ordered `migrationsList` in `mikro-orm.config.ts`; never edit it by hand. An
   unregistered migration does not run; `test/unit/db/migrations-registry.test.ts` and
   `overlay:check` both fail the build for a stale artefact.
3. **Do not order by hand.** Declaration order in the registry has no effect — and there is
   nothing to reorder, since regenerating restores it. Execution order is computed by
   `backend/src/db/migration-order.ts` from the timestamps, corrected by the module-manifest
   dependency graph (45-day horizon). If `db:fresh` fails on ordering, bump the timestamp or
   fix the manifest `dependencies`.
4. **Cross-module FK ⇒ declare the dependency.** A new foreign key to another module's table
   requires that module in your manifest's `dependencies` (transitively), or
   `pnpm --filter backend exec vitest run test/unit/db/fk-dependency-drift.test.ts` fails.
5. **Renaming an applied migration class costs a database rebuild.** Since feature 072 there
   is no frozen name map and nothing in the repository forbids the rename — but
   `mikro_orm_migrations` stores the **class name**, so every database that already ran the
   migration under its old name will see the new name as pending and try to re-apply it.
   Rename only when moving a migration between groups is genuinely required (as feature 072
   T020 did), and ship the rename with a note telling every developer to rebuild:
   `DATABASE_URL=…/b2b_test pnpm --filter backend run db:fresh` plus
   `pnpm --filter backend run db:reset` for the dev database.
6. **Never scaffold a migration stamped at or before `UNCORRECTED_THROUGH`**
   (`20260801T000000`, `backend/src/db/migration-order.ts`). Everything at or before it is
   the pre-065 block: it is emitted in plain chronological order and is **not**
   dependency-corrected, so a migration landing there silently loses the ordering its
   manifest `dependencies` are supposed to buy it. `migration:new` clamps the stamp for you;
   do not hand-write one below the watermark.

**Entities are registered the same way.** `backend/src/db/entities-registry.generated.ts`
comes out of the same command and the same walk: add the `@Entity()` class under the
module's `entities/`, run `composer:generate`, commit the artefact. Both registries are
core-only — an overlay module cannot ship a migration, so the generator refuses an entity or
a migration under `backend/src/apps/` rather than emitting schema nothing creates.

Full guide: `docs/docs/architecture/migrations.md`; contracts under
`specs/065-manifest-aware-migrations/contracts/`.

### i18n

All user-facing strings ship in **both `en` and `pl`**; a static CI check rejects hard-coded
literals in the admin SPA (`pnpm --filter backend run i18n:hardcoded`, in the `quality` job since
issue #116 — before that it was cited here while running nowhere). It compares the tree to
`HARDCODED_STRINGS_BASELINE`, a **per-file two-way ratchet** over the 274 pre-existing findings: a
new hard-coded string fails, and so does a baseline number left standing after the strings under it
were translated. Never raise a number to make the build pass — add the key. Run
`pnpm --filter backend run i18n:hardcoded -- --strict` to see the whole remaining debt, or pass one
path while draining a screen.

## Static checks and their escape hatches

**Adding or changing a check?** It needs an entry in
`backend/test/unit/scripts/check-inventory.test.ts` (which enumerates every `check-*` script
and fails on one it does not name), a companion test, and an exit code of **2** for "nothing
was read" — an empty file list, a missing input, a tree it could not walk. A green result
must not be able to mean "not looking": that is issue #113.

The inventory entry carries the red proofs, and two properties decide whether they are worth
anything (issue #130). **The fixture enters at the top of the analysis** — source text, a
file map, an injected reader, a fixture tree on disk — never a value the check normally
computes: the entry for `check-entry-scope` handed a *pre-classified* record to the last
function in the chain, so the classifier it was supposed to protect never ran, and the
`setInterval(`-only grep inside it hid a live FR-020 gap. A fixture that enters below the
defect cannot catch it. And **one proof per shape the check claims to refuse**, each
asserting the finding's kind, or four of a check's five signals can go blind behind the
fifth's red. `docs/docs/architecture/kernel.md` § *Writing a check that can go red* is the
working guide.

Both run in CI as GitLab's `quality:static` job — full tree, every MR and every push to
`master`. They need only bash, grep, perl and POSIX awk (no `pnpm install`), so keep them
free of gawk-isms and of anything that assumes a node toolchain. Neither script may pass on
an empty file list; both exit 2 when `git` is missing rather than reporting a vacuous green.

`pnpm run check:language` (Principle VIII) scans source-code **comments** and `docs/docs/**`
pages for Polish. It ignores cited terms — anything inside backticks, `"quotes"`, a fenced
code block, or (in docs) markdown emphasis — because an English comment routinely has to
quote a Polish UI label, currency rendering or expected test string. **If it flags you, cite
the term rather than translating it.** Two deliberate carve-outs exist:

- Polish proper nouns with no English form (state institutions, official registries, the
  Polish names of shipped features) live in the `proper_nouns` list in
  `scripts/check-language.sh`. Keep it short — a UI label is a citation, not a proper noun.
- An intrinsically bilingual page opts out with `check-language: allow-non-english` plus a
  reason, in its YAML front matter. Currently only the EN→PL glossary
  (`docs/docs/contributing/translations.md`) qualifies.

`pnpm run check:naming` (Principle VI) checks backend module folder shape, migration
identifiers, Zod contract keys and route segments. Module folders are plural snake_case;
`_`-prefixed infra modules (`_i18n`, `_lifecycle`), singular named surfaces and vendor/
protocol proper nouns are allow-listed in `scripts/check-naming.sh`. A `z.object()` field
that must stay snake_case because it is **persisted verbatim** (a JSONB envelope with a SQL
column default, an external vendor's wire format) is marked with `naming:allow-snake-case`
plus a reason in a comment directly above the field — see `cmsContentEnvelopeSchema` in
`packages/contracts/src/cms.ts`. Do not use it to skip a genuine API-shape fix.

### The full inventory

Every check that runs in CI, so a rule cited nowhere here stops being a rule nobody knew about
(issue #137 — `check:harness-teardown` had run in every pipeline since issue #111 while this
file had never heard of it). Run with `pnpm --filter backend run <name>` unless the row says
otherwise. `backend/test/unit/scripts/check-inventory.test.ts` is the machine-checked version
of this table: it enumerates every `check-*` script and fails on one it does not name.

| Script | Job | What it refuses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `check:command-coverage` | `quality` | A sensitive write that neither runs a Command nor records an audit row (Principle XIII). `--strict` in CI, so a finding in any module fails. |
| `check:container-imports` | `quality` | A module importing the container library — a module sees `ModuleContext` and nothing else (feature 072, FR-032). |
| `check:doc-snippets` | `quality` | A code block marked `<!-- verbatim-from: <path> -->` that no longer appears verbatim in that file. The quickstarts are copied by every module conversion, so a stale snippet is a defect scheduled for mass production. |
| `check:entry-presence` | `quality` | A module-owned `setInterval`, self-rescheduling `setTimeout`, `process.on` handler or **working `ctx.onBoot` hook** that does not decide presence before it works (issues #126, #146). A contribution hook passes silently; one that mixes work with a contribution is reported as `mixed-boot-hook`, and its remedy is "split it first", never "probe the top" — probing a mixed hook stops the contribution too. Non-deactivatable modules are out of the boot-hook population, derived from their manifests through `scripts/lib/switchable-modules.ts` (shared with `check:port-catches`). `TIMERS_WITHOUT_PRESENCE` and `BOOT_HOOKS_WITHOUT_PRESENCE` are two-way and are not expected to empty. |
| `check:entry-scope` | `quality` | A non-HTTP entry point — CLI script, BullMQ consumer, repeating-timer sweep — that does not establish its scope explicitly (feature 072, FR-020). |
| `check:error-translations` | `quality` | An operator-visible error code with no sentence in both shipped languages. The envelope replaces the message wholesale, so a missing key renders the raw code and nothing reports it. Ledger may only shrink. |
| `check:fixture-substitution` | `quality` | A test that turns "the row is not there" into a value that looks like data (issue #159). Six files carried `(await em.findOne(SalesChannel, { systemDefault: true }))?.id ?? ''` and were green only because another file's `setupBackendServer` had created the channel first. Sees both shapes (two-step and inline) and the fabricating fallbacks — a string, a number, `randomUUID()`; `?? null`, `expect(x ?? null)` normalisation and a fallback that *creates* the fixture are outside the population, because each keeps the absence visible. `DEFAULTED_FIXTURE_READS` is two-way and is not expected to empty: an entry says why the fallback is right. |
| `check:harness-teardown` | `quality` | A test that releases a `setupBackendServer` resource itself instead of calling `teardownBackendServer` (issue #111). A hand-written teardown is a copy of the seam frozen when it was copied, so it cannot learn about the awilix container or the pub/sub Redis client, and both leak for the length of the single-fork run. `HAND_RELEASED_RESOURCES_TO_DRAIN` is an empty two-way ratchet. |
| `check:kernel-boundary` | `quality` | An ORM relation from a module into another module; a module may relate into the kernel, the kernel into neither (feature 072, D-32). |
| `check:module-boundary` | `quality` | **Two predicates, one ledger.** (1) A module naming an import specifier that resolves into another module's directory (Principle I; feature 075). Every specifier shape, `import type` included — it is 43% of the debt, and ESLint's `prefer: 'type-imports'` would otherwise launder value imports into it. (2) A module naming another module's **table in raw SQL** (feature 077, D-87) — 116 such statements stand today, invisible to predicate 1 because raw SQL names no specifier, and a `violations=0` that cannot see them licenses a package split that is 116 couplings short of true. The table→owner map has **two sources and needs both**: `@Entity()` table names (220) and `create table` DDL (21 more, every join table and every `sales_channel_*` bridge among them); a core-block table is attributed to the module that owns the table its name begins with. The predicate reads literal **nodes**, so a comment is out of the population by construction. The ledger is **sharded per consumer module** under `backend/scripts/ledgers/cross-module-imports/`, so a cut touches one file; it fails six ways — unledgered reach, stale entry, empty shard, orphan shard, entry filed under another module's shard, and a `permanent: true` entry with no retiring condition. `ledger-size` is derived and printed, never written down, covers both kinds, and excludes the permanent entries: an edge a foreign key holds co-transactional is not debt (D-77), so it is declared `{ permanent: true, reason, retiredBy }`, printed separately, and refused if `retiredBy` names the sweep. Exit 2 when **either** owner-map pass resolves zero tables — a half-blind map reports fewer findings rather than an error (issue #113). |
| `check:port-catches` | `quality` | A `catch` that swallows `ModuleDisabledError` — see composition checklist item 7. Since D-88 it also follows the gate **one hop backwards**: a method of the same class whose body reaches a port carries, for a `catch` around `this.<method>()`, transitively inside the class. That is not the propagation the header refuses — that one carries a call's *result* **forward** into every downstream and produced 39 false findings; this carries a callee's *body* **backward** to the call site, through `this` and nothing else. A free function in another file, a callback from outside the class and a method on a non-port collaborator are all outside it, deliberately; a class method also **shadows** a module-scoped alias of the same spelling. |
| `check:port-dependencies` | `quality` | A cross-module port edge the resolver's manifest does not declare, and an edge with no deactivation-consequence classification — see checklist items 4 and 4a. Also verifies `PLATFORM_OWNED_NAMES`, which grants both of those exemptions, against the three supply sources a composition really has — the two roots and `src/kernel/**` — for four findings: unsupplied, one-root divergence, owned-by-a-module and stale (issue #49). The list stays hand-written; every consequence of being on it is derived. |
| `check:subscribe-seam` | `quality` | A bare `eventBus.on` in a module instead of `ctx.subscribe` (issue #107). Empty two-way ledger. |
| `i18n:hardcoded` | `quality` | A user-visible literal in the admin SPA — see the i18n checklist above. |
| `overlay:check` | `quality` | A generated artefact that is stale, missing, or rendered empty: the composer, the manifest index, both `db/` registries, and every override manifest — bare core plus one per deployment under `backend/src/apps/` (issue #120). |
| `pnpm run check:naming` | `quality:static` | Principle VI, above. |
| `pnpm run check:language` | `quality:static` | Principle VIII, above. |
| `pnpm run check:pdfmake-footprint` | `quality` | A pdfmake font bundle over the single-VPS disk budget (Constitution IV). |

Two more run in the same job with no npm script of their own, through
`pnpm --filter backend exec tsx scripts/<name>.ts`: `check-entity-tenant-classification`
(every persisted entity carries exactly one tenant-scope decorator, feature 050) and
`check-channel-resolution --enforce` (no re-resolution of the sales channel outside the
canonical resolver, and no settings read naming its channel with a string literal — feature
053 FR-011, feature 072 D-42).

## Overlay modules (per-deployment customization, feature 057)

A **client-only overlay module** lives under `backend/src/apps/<deployment>/modules/<id>/` and
is discovered without editing the shared core registry (`REGISTERED_MANIFESTS` stays
untouched — FR-004). It is an ordinary lifecycle participant, so every checklist above
applies, with one difference: its admin permissions must appear on `/admin-roles` and pass
the permission-inventory check **for that deployment** — run the inventory test with
`DEPLOYMENT=<name>` set. Overriding a core **service** is a **decoration**, not a file
shadowing it (feature 072): a file under `backend/src/apps/<deployment>/decorations/`, named
after the registration it wraps, exporting `decorate(inner)` — it receives the core
implementation and returns one that delegates to it, so core fixes keep flowing. `tsc` is the
contract gate: the decoration is written against the core service's `*.interface.ts` and
stops being assignable when that interface changes. A `services/` file under an overlay is
now an **unknown override target** and fails the build.
Never override a core entity or migration (schema overrides are out of v1) —
ship new schema as tables owned by the overlay module. See
`docs/docs/architecture/overlay-pattern.md` and `specs/057-overlay-pattern-multideploy/`.

## Working agreement

- **Verify before reporting done**: `typecheck` + `lint` + the targeted tests for what you
  touched. Report failures with their output; never hide them.
- **Read before writing** — the module you are changing, the closest prior feature's spec
  directory, and the relevant contracts.
- **English only** in code, comments, identifiers, specs, docs and commit messages
  (Principle VIII).
- **Commits**: never add `Co-Authored-By: Claude` or any other AI/LLM trailer. Branch off
  `master` and deliver through a merge request — never commit straight to `master`.
- **Do not touch**: generated files, another module's migrations, or the auto-generated
  appendix at the bottom of this file.

Specs written before 2026-07-31 refer to the checklists above as "the CLAUDE.md new-module
rules" — same rules, they simply moved here.

## Feature workflow (speckit)

New features follow the speckit flow: `/speckit.specify` → `/speckit.plan` → `/speckit.tasks`
→ `/speckit.implement`, producing `specs/NNN-slug/`. `/speckit.plan` regenerates the appendix
below through `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh`, which is pinned to write into
this file only (see the repo-local override near the top of that script) — that is what keeps
`CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/rules/specify-rules.mdc` and this file from drifting apart again.

## Subagents

Role-specialised subagents are defined twice, once per tool, with identical roles:
`.claude/agents/*.md` (Claude Code) and `.cursor/agents/*.md` (Cursor). Their prompts stay
short on purpose — repository conventions live here, not in the agent files.

| Agent | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `endora-commerce-architect` | Designing features: specs, plans, module boundaries, data models |
| `endora-commerce-dev` | Implementing plans and fixing bugs, with tests |
| `endora-commerce-designer` | Designing and auditing UI: commerce surfaces (cart, checkout, PDP, PLP), admin screens, UX/accessibility reviews |
| `endora-commerce-product-owner` | Verifying business ↔ implementation consistency, spec/task audits, `docs/` |

## UX laws

`.claude/skills/ux-laws/SKILL.md` is the **single source of truth** for the UX rules applied to
every UI change — the Laws of UX (<https://lawsofux.com/>) rewritten as actionable frontend
rules, plus the WCAG 2.2 AA floor, the repo's design tokens and primitives, and the required
component states. Unlike the subagent prompts it is **not duplicated per tool**: the Cursor
agent reads that path directly. Update it in place; never fork a second copy.
