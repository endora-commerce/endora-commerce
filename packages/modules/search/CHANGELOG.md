## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 10a17f0: The liveness and readiness probe is the platform's, and `@endora-commerce/mod-health-checks` is gone.

  `GET /api/v1/_health` is now registered by `@endora-commerce/platform` itself: `composeApp`
  puts `healthRoutePlugin({ orm, redis })` at the head of the module plugins it returns, and
  `composeTestServer` does the same, so an instance serves the probe because it is an Endora
  instance rather than because a module the scaffolder happened to select is installed. It was
  not: `endora new instance` writes the closure over the modules declaring
  `activation.nonDeactivatable`, `health_checks` declared no activation block at all, and no
  manifest named it as a dependency — so a scaffolded instance answered 404 on the route
  `deploy/compose.prod.yml` healthchecks, its API container never became healthy, and its
  storefront, which waits on `service_healthy`, never started. Moving the route also closes the
  withdrawal: `assertDeactivatable` returns early for a module with no activation block, so
  `module:uninstall health_checks` was accepted and an operator could take the liveness endpoint
  off a running instance with one command. Owner ruling D-229.

  **What a consumer has to do.** Nothing, if the instance composes through `composeApp` or
  `composeTestServer` — the route arrives with the platform. Remove
  `@endora-commerce/mod-health-checks` from the instance manifest; it no longer resolves. The
  route, its path, its payload and its status codes are unchanged.

  `@endora-commerce/platform/composition` gains `healthRoutePlugin`, `registerHealthRoutes`,
  `platformHealthProbes`, `healthResponseSchema`, `HealthDeps`, `HealthProbeSources` and
  `HealthResponse`. No new subpath: `./http` is untouched, because no module names any of this.

  `MEILISEARCH_URL` and `npm_package_version` are declared by the platform now, with the
  sentences the dissolved manifest carried. `@endora-commerce/mod-search` therefore stops
  declaring `MEILISEARCH_URL` — one variable may not carry two descriptions, and a module may not
  describe a platform input — while continuing to read it and to declare
  `MEILISEARCH_API_KEY`. **An operator-visible consequence:** the surviving declaration is
  `optional`, where `search`'s was `required`. Both readers have always defaulted to
  `http://localhost:7700`, so the requirement was aspirational, but a prompt built from these
  declarations will no longer insist on the value.

- 02838b7: Nine modules now declare the environment inputs they own, in `manifest.env`, so a
  client who installs them can be told what to put in their `.env`. Each declaration
  carries an English and a Polish sentence, a requirement, and — for an `optional`
  one — what is lost without it.

  `health_checks` was the tenth until D-229 dissolved it into the platform; its two
  declarations went with it, and `search`'s `MEILISEARCH_URL` went with them,
  because the platform now declares that name and a module may not describe a
  platform input a second time.

  Nothing changes at runtime: no module reads a new variable and none changes how it
  reads an existing one. What changes is that the requirement is now on the wire, in
  the manifest the platform already carries, and reaches a consumer through the
  package's own `exports` map.

  Every module here declares only what it **owns**. The seven platform-owned names
  these modules read — `NODE_ENV`, `BACKEND_ROLE`, `STOREFRONT_BASE_URL`,
  `PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`, `BACKEND_PUBLIC_URL`, `REVALIDATE_SECRET` and
  `SETTINGS_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` — are declared by `@endora-commerce/platform` and
  are deliberately not repeated here.

### Patch Changes

- 52c2bfd: `SearchReindexPort` is published: the container name `searchReindexPort`, owned
  by `search`, with the `Container name:` doc block its consumers read.

  It had a registration and no contract, which was invisible while the only
  consumer was a composition root — `check:port-shape`'s population is a module's
  own resolutions, and a root's read is outside it. `catalog` resolves the name
  directly since `specs/117-instance-bring-up/` Phase 6, and the check reported
  it on the first run.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 8f4eea1: The indexer now waits for a Meilisearch task long enough to survive a busy queue, and it
  notices a task that failed.

  Nine of `SearchIndexer`'s twelve task waits passed no `timeout`, taking the `meilisearch`
  client's default of **5000 ms**. That number is the wrong order of magnitude for what is
  being waited on: a task wait is `the queue ahead of this task` + `this task's own work`,
  and Meilisearch's task queue is global to the instance. Measured against Meilisearch 1.x,
  a **one-document** write into an empty index expired the 5000 ms wait after 5006 ms with
  twelve document batches enqueued ahead of it — and then settled `succeeded` 10540 ms
  later. Nothing about that task was slow. A full reindex of a real catalogue, or any
  reindex against a Meilisearch shared with other work, hit the same wall as
  `MeilisearchTaskTimeOutError` thrown out of `reindexChannel`.

  **The second half is the one to read.** `waitForTask` does **not** throw for a task that
  failed — it resolves, carrying `status: 'failed'` and Meilisearch's own `error`. All
  twelve waits discarded that value, so a refused document batch and an applied one were the
  same thing to the caller: `reindexChannel` reported a document count for an index
  Meilisearch had written nothing into. The old code therefore failed loudly on the benign
  case and silently on the malignant one.

  **New setting.** `search.index_task_timeout_seconds`, default `120`, platform-wide. Raise
  it for a large catalogue or a shared Meilisearch instance. It is re-read per wait, so it
  takes effect without a restart. Its default is exported as
  `DEFAULT_INDEX_TASK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` from the manifest and
  `DEFAULT_INDEX_TASK_TIMEOUT_MS` from the indexer.

  **What a consumer will now see.** Two new exported error classes, and the distinction
  between them is the point — they have opposite remedies:

  ```ts
  import {
    SearchIndexTaskFailed, // Meilisearch refused the write; `.meilisearchCode` says why
    SearchIndexTaskStillRunning, // the wait expired; the task was NOT cancelled and may yet succeed
  } from '@endora-commerce/mod-search/backend';
  ```

  `SearchIndexTaskStillRunning` replaces the `MeilisearchTaskTimeOutError` that used to
  escape, and its message names the setting to raise. `SearchIndexTaskFailed` is new
  behaviour rather than a rename: **an indexing failure that was previously silent now
  throws.** If you call `reindexAllChannels`, `reindexChannel`, `upsertProduct`,
  `deleteProduct` or `refreshAttributeSettings` directly, expect to see genuine Meilisearch
  refusals you were not seeing before. The module's own event subscribers are unchanged —
  they log and continue, as they already did.

  `SearchIndexerOptions` gains one **optional** field, `resolveTaskTimeoutMs?: () => Promise<number>`;
  omitted, it answers the manifest default, so existing construction sites keep compiling and
  behave identically.

### Patch Changes

- fe63714: Documentation only: the reindex page named `seed:dev`, the script feature 113
  replaced with `endora demo seed`. No exported symbol, route, service or
  migration changes, and the module's compiled output is byte-identical — but
  `docs/` ships in this package's `files`, so what a consumer receives does
  change.

## 0.7.0

### Major Changes

- 5253b3e: Four promise-form `catch`es stop swallowing `ModuleDisabledError`. Each is a call that
  answered "there is nothing here" for a capability the operator had switched off, and each
  therefore has a new contract for its caller.

  **Breaking — `OrderConfirmationService.resolveAdditional(organizationId, salesChannelId)`.**
  It documented "invalid or empty entries are dropped, never fatal" and returned `[]` for any
  failure of the organisation read, which goes through `organizationDetailsPort`. It now
  rejects with `ModuleDisabledError` when `organizations` is absent and still returns `[]` for
  every other failure.

      // before — an order confirmed with the buyer as its only recipient
      const extra = await confirmation.resolveAdditional(orgId, channelId);

      // after — the caller decides, because it can now tell the two apart
      let extra: string[];
      try {
        extra = await confirmation.resolveAdditional(orgId, channelId);
      } catch (error) {
        rethrowIfModuleDisabled(error);
        throw error;
      }

  **Breaking — `resolveEmbedderConfig(settings, channelId, credentials)`.** It returned the
  empty config, which every caller reads as "LLM search is not configured", for an absent
  `credentials` module as well as for an unset reference. It now rejects with
  `ModuleDisabledError` for the first and still returns the empty config for the second.

  **Breaking — `LlmProviderFactory.capability()` and `.resolve()`.** `capability()` reported
  `not_configured` and `resolve()` threw `AssistantNotConfigured` when `credentials` was
  absent, sending the operator to configure a credential that was already configured. Both now
  let `ModuleDisabledError` through.

  **Breaking — `DeliveryConfigService.remove(productFeedId)`.** The credential cleanup after
  the configuration delete absorbed everything. It now rejects with `ModuleDisabledError` when
  `credentials` is absent — the configuration row is gone and its secret is not, and a retry
  cannot reach the secret because the code that named it went with the row. A credential that
  is merely already gone is still tolerated.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-pim-pimcore` is a rename with no API surface: one file-scoped `worker`
  binding becomes `deliveryWorker`.

### Minor Changes

- ad62954: Fourteen more modules become workspace packages (feature 080, T040b batch three):
  `autopay`, `comparisons`, `credentials`, `dictionaries`, `google_tag_manager`,
  `ksef`, `meta_ads`, `paypal`, `payu`, `quick_order`, `search`, `stripe`, `taxes`
  and `tpay`. Each ships `dist` and resolves through its own `exports` map — the
  root for its manifest, `./backend` for `registerModule` plus the `entities`
  array, `./migrations` for its migration classes — exactly as the twenty-nine
  packages before them.

  **For a consumer of `@endora-commerce/mod-ksef`, one export is new and
  load-bearing.** `KsefUnavailableError` is now published by name on `./backend`:

  ```ts
  import { KsefUnavailableError } from '@endora-commerce/mod-ksef/backend';
  ```

  Anything implementing `KsefApiClientPort` — an overlay's client, a test double,
  a second gateway — must throw **that** class for an outage.
  `classifySubmissionError` decides "retry" from `instanceof`, so a caller holding
  a constructor of its own, or the class from a relative import into this
  package's source, gets its outage classified as `UNEXPECTED`: the submission is
  parked for an operator instead of queued for the sweep, silently. There is no
  behaviour change for a caller that already throws the module's own class.

  Nothing else in any of the fourteen changed shape. The move is a relocation:
  same entities, same migrations, same class names, same tables. The committed
  migration registry's `(moduleId, className)` declaration sequence and its
  computed execution sequence are byte-identical to the merge base — 158 entries,
  `declaration=2db29d89…`, `execution=c794685f…` — because packaging changes no
  manifest `dependencies` and the order is a function of those.

### Patch Changes

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.

- 9a18f41: `search` declares the eight error codes it owns.

  `manifest.ts` gains an `errorCodes` array — feature 090 Phase 3
  (`specs/090-module-owned-error-codes/`). Nothing the package exports changes
  shape. The observable difference for a consumer is that this module's error
  sentences are now routed by its own declaration rather than only by the prefix
  chain in `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`, which continues to answer identically for
  every one of them: the list is the chain's own answer, copied verbatim from the
  frozen capture, and is asserted equal to it in both directions.

  All eight already carry a written sentence in both `en` and `pl` in this
  package's own `i18n/` bundles, and those eight are exactly the `errors.*` keys
  those bundles hold — none is an `UNTRANSLATED_ERROR_CODES` entry — so no
  sentence moves and none is added.

  Six of the eight — `LIMIT_OUT_OF_RANGE`, `PHRASE_REQUIRED`, `PHRASE_TOO_LONG`,
  `QUERY_TOO_LONG`, `QUERY_TOO_SHORT`, `RESULT_COUNT_INVALID` — carry no `SEARCH_`
  prefix and read as generic request-validation codes. They are this module's:
  `routes.public.ts` hand-parses the suggest query precisely so a bad `q` or
  `limit` refuses with one of them instead of the generic `VALIDATION_FAILED`.
  Nothing else in the repository raises any of the six.

  No `tokens`: all seven raise sites of these eight codes were read across
  `packages` and `backend/src`, and none passes a `details.code` discriminator —
  the six that pass a fourth argument at all pass the Zod-style
  `Array<{path, issue}>`, which the envelope ignores by construction.
