## 0.7.0

### Major Changes

- 5253b3e: Four promise-form `catch`es stop swallowing `ModuleDisabledError`. Each is a call that
  answered "there is nothing here" for a capability the operator had switched off, and each
  therefore has a new contract for its caller.

  **Breaking — `OrderConfirmationService.resolveAdditional(organizationId, salesChannelId)`.**
  It documented "invalid or empty entries are dropped, never fatal" and returned `[]` for any
  failure of the organisation read, which goes through `organizationDetailsPort`. It now
  rejects with `ModuleDisabledError` when `organizations` is absent and still returns `[]` for
  every other failure.

      // before — an order confirmed with the buyer as its only recipient
      const extra = await confirmation.resolveAdditional(orgId, channelId);

      // after — the caller decides, because it can now tell the two apart
      let extra: string[];
      try {
        extra = await confirmation.resolveAdditional(orgId, channelId);
      } catch (error) {
        rethrowIfModuleDisabled(error);
        throw error;
      }

  **Breaking — `resolveEmbedderConfig(settings, channelId, credentials)`.** It returned the
  empty config, which every caller reads as "LLM search is not configured", for an absent
  `credentials` module as well as for an unset reference. It now rejects with
  `ModuleDisabledError` for the first and still returns the empty config for the second.

  **Breaking — `LlmProviderFactory.capability()` and `.resolve()`.** `capability()` reported
  `not_configured` and `resolve()` threw `AssistantNotConfigured` when `credentials` was
  absent, sending the operator to configure a credential that was already configured. Both now
  let `ModuleDisabledError` through.

  **Breaking — `DeliveryConfigService.remove(productFeedId)`.** The credential cleanup after
  the configuration delete absorbed everything. It now rejects with `ModuleDisabledError` when
  `credentials` is absent — the configuration row is gone and its secret is not, and a retry
  cannot reach the secret because the code that named it went with the row. A credential that
  is merely already gone is still tolerated.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-pim-pimcore` is a rename with no API surface: one file-scoped `worker`
  binding becomes `deliveryWorker`.

### Minor Changes

- ad62954: Fourteen more modules become workspace packages (feature 080, T040b batch three):
  `autopay`, `comparisons`, `credentials`, `dictionaries`, `google_tag_manager`,
  `ksef`, `meta_ads`, `paypal`, `payu`, `quick_order`, `search`, `stripe`, `taxes`
  and `tpay`. Each ships `dist` and resolves through its own `exports` map — the
  root for its manifest, `./backend` for `registerModule` plus the `entities`
  array, `./migrations` for its migration classes — exactly as the twenty-nine
  packages before them.

  **For a consumer of `@endora-commerce/mod-ksef`, one export is new and
  load-bearing.** `KsefUnavailableError` is now published by name on `./backend`:

  ```ts
  import { KsefUnavailableError } from '@endora-commerce/mod-ksef/backend';
  ```

  Anything implementing `KsefApiClientPort` — an overlay's client, a test double,
  a second gateway — must throw **that** class for an outage.
  `classifySubmissionError` decides "retry" from `instanceof`, so a caller holding
  a constructor of its own, or the class from a relative import into this
  package's source, gets its outage classified as `UNEXPECTED`: the submission is
  parked for an operator instead of queued for the sweep, silently. There is no
  behaviour change for a caller that already throws the module's own class.

  Nothing else in any of the fourteen changed shape. The move is a relocation:
  same entities, same migrations, same class names, same tables. The committed
  migration registry's `(moduleId, className)` declaration sequence and its
  computed execution sequence are byte-identical to the merge base — 158 entries,
  `declaration=2db29d89…`, `execution=c794685f…` — because packaging changes no
  manifest `dependencies` and the order is a function of those.

### Patch Changes

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.

- 9a18f41: `search` declares the eight error codes it owns.

  `manifest.ts` gains an `errorCodes` array — feature 090 Phase 3
  (`specs/090-module-owned-error-codes/`). Nothing the package exports changes
  shape. The observable difference for a consumer is that this module's error
  sentences are now routed by its own declaration rather than only by the prefix
  chain in `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`, which continues to answer identically for
  every one of them: the list is the chain's own answer, copied verbatim from the
  frozen capture, and is asserted equal to it in both directions.

  All eight already carry a written sentence in both `en` and `pl` in this
  package's own `i18n/` bundles, and those eight are exactly the `errors.*` keys
  those bundles hold — none is an `UNTRANSLATED_ERROR_CODES` entry — so no
  sentence moves and none is added.

  Six of the eight — `LIMIT_OUT_OF_RANGE`, `PHRASE_REQUIRED`, `PHRASE_TOO_LONG`,
  `QUERY_TOO_LONG`, `QUERY_TOO_SHORT`, `RESULT_COUNT_INVALID` — carry no `SEARCH_`
  prefix and read as generic request-validation codes. They are this module's:
  `routes.public.ts` hand-parses the suggest query precisely so a bad `q` or
  `limit` refuses with one of them instead of the generic `VALIDATION_FAILED`.
  Nothing else in the repository raises any of the six.

  No `tokens`: all seven raise sites of these eight codes were read across
  `packages` and `backend/src`, and none passes a `details.code` discriminator —
  the six that pass a fourth argument at all pass the Zod-style
  `Array<{path, issue}>`, which the envelope ignores by construction.
