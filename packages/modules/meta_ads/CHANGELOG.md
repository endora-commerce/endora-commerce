### Minor Changes

- e27bf6c: Every package that ships scannable UI now publishes its own Tailwind `@source`
  declarations at a new `./tailwind.css` subpath.

  A host compiling this package's utility classes no longer has to know where the
  package's sources are. Import the subpath from the stylesheet that builds your
  admin, and the package names its own layers:

  ```css
  @import 'tailwindcss';
  @import '@endora-commerce/mod-blog/tailwind.css';
  ```

  `@source` resolves relative to the stylesheet that declares it, so the paths hold
  wherever the package is installed. The file is generated from the package's layer
  inventory, ships in the tarball beside `package.json`, and its `dist` line is the one
  that matters to you — the `src` line beside it is inert in a published package and
  exists so that a checkout of this repository keeps scanning source in `dev`.

  **Nothing is removed or renamed**: every existing subpath resolves exactly as before.
  What is new is the obligation on the _host_ side, and it is a build error rather than a
  silent one. Before this, a host reached these packages with a glob over the monorepo
  (`@source "../../packages/**"`), which named a directory no installed tree has —
  and Tailwind reports nothing at all about a source that matches nothing, so such a host
  built green and rendered every screen unstyled. A host that now names a package that is
  not installed gets `Can't resolve`, and one whose tarball omits the file gets
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.

  `@endora-commerce/cms-components` deliberately does **not** publish this subpath. It
  ships a finished, prefixed stylesheet at `./styles.css` and must not also be scanned by
  its host.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 0e8e473: `linkedin_ads` and `meta_ads` ship their admin surfaces, on a new `./admin` subpath each.

  Each package now exports `contributions` from `@endora-commerce/mod-linkedin-ads/admin` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-meta-ads/admin` — three routes (the mapping list, `/new` and `/:id`)
  and one sidebar entry — as an `AdminContributions` object. Every component is a
  dynamic-import factory, and the two editor routes share one factory value, so a consumer's
  bundler emits one chunk for the editor rather than two.

  Three things a consumer has to know:
  - **The sidebar label moved namespace.** `appShell.nav.linkedinAds` and
    `appShell.nav.metaAds` were in `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`'s shared `core` bundle; they
    are now `nav.linkedInAds.label` and `nav.metaAds.label` in each package's own `i18n/`,
    resolved in the module's own scope. Anything reading an old key gets a raw key back. The
    text itself is unchanged in both languages. The screens' own keys did not move — they
    were already in each module's bundle.
  - **Each admin API client gains `listSalesChannels()`.** The two screens label a mapping's
    channel, and they used to do it by importing `sales_channels`' admin client out of the
    admin application. They now call `GET /api/v1/admin/sales-channels?activeOnly=false&pageSize=100`
    themselves and type the answer with `SalesChannelListResponse` from
    `@endora-commerce/contracts`. It is deliberately duplicated in the two packages rather
    than shared: the only place two modules could share it is `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`,
    and the kit holds no module knowledge.
  - **Each package peers on `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`, `react` and `react-router-dom`.**
    They are peers rather than dependencies for the reason `page-builder-core` is: the
    application must resolve exactly one copy, and a provider in one copy against a consumer
    in the other is a `null` context at runtime rather than a type error.

- ad62954: Fourteen more modules become workspace packages (feature 080, T040b batch three):
  `autopay`, `comparisons`, `credentials`, `dictionaries`, `google_tag_manager`,
  `ksef`, `meta_ads`, `paypal`, `payu`, `quick_order`, `search`, `stripe`, `taxes`
  and `tpay`. Each ships `dist` and resolves through its own `exports` map — the
  root for its manifest, `./backend` for `registerModule` plus the `entities`
  array, `./migrations` for its migration classes — exactly as the twenty-nine
  packages before them.

  **For a consumer of `@endora-commerce/mod-ksef`, one export is new and
  load-bearing.** `KsefUnavailableError` is now published by name on `./backend`:

  ```ts
  import { KsefUnavailableError } from '@endora-commerce/mod-ksef/backend';
  ```

  Anything implementing `KsefApiClientPort` — an overlay's client, a test double,
  a second gateway — must throw **that** class for an outage.
  `classifySubmissionError` decides "retry" from `instanceof`, so a caller holding
  a constructor of its own, or the class from a relative import into this
  package's source, gets its outage classified as `UNEXPECTED`: the submission is
  parked for an operator instead of queued for the sweep, silently. There is no
  behaviour change for a caller that already throws the module's own class.

  Nothing else in any of the fourteen changed shape. The move is a relocation:
  same entities, same migrations, same class names, same tables. The committed
  migration registry's `(moduleId, className)` declaration sequence and its
  computed execution sequence are byte-identical to the merge base — 158 entries,
  `declaration=2db29d89…`, `execution=c794685f…` — because packaging changes no
  manifest `dependencies` and the order is a function of those.
