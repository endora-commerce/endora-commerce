# @endora-commerce/mod-carts

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 0eeb9b5: Require Node >= 22.18.0.

  The previous floor was 22.17.0, which MikroORM 7 sets. 22.18.0 is the first release that
  strips TypeScript types without a flag, and that is what loads a deployment's overlay module:
  in a scaffolded instance `apps/` is outside every compiled member, so the unit the platform
  `import()`s is the client's own `.ts`. On 22.17.x that import throws
  `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` and the process dies before it listens. Emitting a `.js` beside
  the client's source was measured and refused — the overlay loader resolves `.js` before `.ts`
  while the divergence derivation admits both, so the sibling doubles every seam site in the
  report.

  Derived by probing 22.17.0, 22.17.1, 22.18.0 and 22.19.0 against a `.ts` module imported with
  no flag; 22.18.0 is the lowest that loads it.

  If you run 22.17.x, upgrade to 22.18 or later. Nothing else in these packages changed.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- e27bf6c: Every package that ships scannable UI now publishes its own Tailwind `@source`
  declarations at a new `./tailwind.css` subpath.

  A host compiling this package's utility classes no longer has to know where the
  package's sources are. Import the subpath from the stylesheet that builds your
  admin, and the package names its own layers:

  ```css
  @import 'tailwindcss';
  @import '@endora-commerce/mod-blog/tailwind.css';
  ```

  `@source` resolves relative to the stylesheet that declares it, so the paths hold
  wherever the package is installed. The file is generated from the package's layer
  inventory, ships in the tarball beside `package.json`, and its `dist` line is the one
  that matters to you — the `src` line beside it is inert in a published package and
  exists so that a checkout of this repository keeps scanning source in `dev`.

  **Nothing is removed or renamed**: every existing subpath resolves exactly as before.
  What is new is the obligation on the _host_ side, and it is a build error rather than a
  silent one. Before this, a host reached these packages with a glob over the monorepo
  (`@source "../../packages/**"`), which named a directory no installed tree has —
  and Tailwind reports nothing at all about a source that matches nothing, so such a host
  built green and rendered every screen unstyled. A host that now names a package that is
  not installed gets `Can't resolve`, and one whose tarball omits the file gets
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.

  `@endora-commerce/cms-components` deliberately does **not** publish this subpath. It
  ships a finished, prefixed stylesheet at `./styles.css` and must not also be scanned by
  its host.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- e5ae42c: `mfa`, `carts`, `audit_logs`, `admin_users` and `admin_roles` ship their admin surfaces, on a
  new `./admin` subpath each.

  Each of the five now exports `contributions` from `@endora-commerce/mod-<id>/admin` as an
  `AdminContributions` object — six routes and three sidebar entries between them. Every
  component is a dynamic-import factory, so a consumer's bundler emits one chunk per screen.

  Six things a consumer has to know:
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-admin-roles/admin` declares a sidebar entry and no route.** The
    `/admin-roles` screen is served by `GET /api/v1/admin/admin-roles` in `admin_users`, so
    `@endora-commerce/mod-admin-users/admin` declares that route alongside its own
    `/admin-users`, while `admin_roles` declares the sidebar entry and the palette action that
    advertise it. All three arrays of `AdminContributions` are optional and a nav-only
    contribution is supported; a consumer rendering the registry needs both packages for the
    roles screen to be both reachable and advertised.
  - **Three sidebar labels moved namespace.** `appShell.nav.users`, `appShell.nav.roles` and
    `appShell.nav.auditLog` were in `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`'s shared `core` bundle; they
    are now `nav.adminUsers.label`, `nav.adminRoles.label` and `nav.auditLog.label` in each
    package's own `i18n/`, resolved in the module's own scope. Anything reading an old key gets
    a raw key back. The text is unchanged in both languages, and the screens' own keys did not
    move.
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-admin-users` and `@endora-commerce/mod-audit-logs` ship an `i18n/`
    directory for the first time**, and their manifests declare `i18n.bundlesDir` accordingly.
    A consumer that mirrored `files` by hand needs the new directory.
  - **Three packages declare `actions` for the first time**: `open-admin-users`,
    `open-admin-roles` and `open-audit-log`. They are ⌘K palette entries, resolved by the
    server against the effective enabled-set, and they pay three of the fifteen remaining
    entries in this repository's Principle XVI debt. `mfa` and `carts` still declare none —
    neither contributes a sidebar entry, which is that debt's population.
  - **`@endora-commerce/contracts` adds `ShieldCheck` to `KnownIconNameSchema`**, and
    `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`'s `resolveIcon` maps it. Additive: no existing name changes,
    and a consumer validating an icon name against the old enum keeps working. It is needed
    because a nav entry declares its glyph **by name**, so keeping the one the sidebar already
    drew meant adding the name rather than substituting one already on the list.
  - **All five packages now peer on `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`, `react` and, where a screen
    routes, `react-router-dom` and `lucide-react`.** They are peers rather than dependencies
    for the reason `page-builder-core` is: the application must resolve exactly one copy, and a
    provider in one copy against a consumer in the other is a `null` context at runtime rather
    than a type error.

- f2ffa45: `carts` refuses a row that names a customer account and no organisation.

  A new migration adds
  `check ("customer_account_id" is null or "organization_id" is not null)` to the
  `carts` table, after deriving the missing organisation from the account that
  owns the cart and refusing — with the count and up to twenty ids, deleting
  nothing — anything left over.

  **Why it matters to anything writing this table.** `Cart` is `@CustomerScoped`
  and carries its own `organization_id`, and the tenant filter's `allowed-set` arm
  reads that column: a sales representative sees the carts of the organisations
  they are assigned to. MikroORM applies no filter to `INSERT`, so until now a
  cart written with an account and a null organisation was simply invisible to
  that representative, with nothing anywhere reporting it. The database is the
  only place that refusal can live.

  **What can break.** An insert or update that sets `customer_account_id` without
  setting `organization_id` now fails with a check violation instead of writing a
  row nobody can attribute. Every write path in this package already stamps it —
  `CartService`'s owned-create branch does, its anonymous branch legitimately
  leaves both columns null, and the anonymous→customer merge completes the
  anonymous cart rather than re-owning it — so no call site changes. A fixture or
  an external writer that built a cart by hand is the case to look at.

  The constraint is an **implication**, not an equivalence: an ownerless cart is a
  representable state and needs no organisation. No foreign key is added.

- e637f56: Seven more modules become workspace packages (feature 080, T040b batch four):
  `assets_library`, `carts`, `custom_fields`, `customers`, `email`, `invoices` and
  `settings`. Each ships `dist` and resolves through its own `exports` map — the
  root for its manifest, `./backend` for `registerModule` plus the `entities`
  array, `./migrations` for its migration classes where it owns any — exactly as
  the forty-three packages before them.

  Three things a consumer of one of these packages should know.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-carts`, `@endora-commerce/mod-custom-fields` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-invoices` publish a `./ports` subpath.** It is type-only:
  `tsc` emits `export {};`, and it is where a consumer names
  `CartPlacementApplyPort`, `CustomFieldDefinitionApplyApi` and
  `InvoicePlacementApplyPort` instead of reaching into the owner's directory.

  ```ts
  import type { CartPlacementApplyPort } from '@endora-commerce/mod-carts/ports';
  ```

  The implementations stay behind their container names
  (`cartPlacementApplyPort`, `customFieldDefinitionApplyApi`,
  `invoicePlacementApplyPort`) and are resolved with `lazyPort`, never through
  this subpath.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-settings` declares `entities` as an empty array.** The
  module owns no table — the settings store is the platform's — and the empty
  array is the statement, because the host reads a _missing_ export as `[]` and a
  forgotten one would be indistinguishable from an honest none.

  **No entity class is exported by name from any of the seven**, `import type`
  included (D-168). A consumer that must construct one takes it off the published
  `entities` array by name; `Cart`, `Invoice` and the rest are deliberately not
  importable.

- 184fa9f: Two detail-screen zone members, four contributors, and the end of two live component
  duplications.

  `@endora-commerce/contracts` adds two members to `AdminZoneNameSchema`, each with its entry
  in `AdminZonePropsMap`:

  | Member                      | Props                                            | Rendered by                                         |
  | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
  | `organization.detail.after` | `OrganizationDetailZoneProps { organizationId }` | the end of the organization detail screen, **once** |
  | `customer.detail.after`     | `CustomerDetailZoneProps { customerId }`         | the end of the customer detail screen, **once**     |

  `OrganizationDetailZoneProps` and `CustomerDetailZoneProps` are new exported interfaces. The
  second is not an alias of the first: the prop is named for the entity the mount carries, and
  the two members are two places.

  **One mount per screen is a rule, not a layout choice.** Neither member carries a prop that
  could tell two mounts apart, so a second mount of either renders every contribution twice
  and nothing in the renderer can distinguish them.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-quick-order` gains an `./admin` subpath — its first — with two zone
  contributions and `DefaultPreferencesPanel`, which moves into the package. The panel's two
  preference calls are rebuilt from the published `apiClient`; `quick-order-client.ts` stays in
  the admin application, where the on-behalf-of screen still uses it.

  ```tsx
  // Both contributions declare `orders:write`, which is the code every admin
  // route this module owns enforces. There is no `quick_order:*` permission.
  zoneComponent('organization.detail.after', () => import('./zones/OrganizationDefaults.js'), {
    weight: 300,
    requiredPermission: 'orders:write',
  });
  ```

  `@endora-commerce/mod-carts` gains its first zone contribution and a new route,
  `GET /api/v1/admin/organizations/:id/cart-approval-policy`, gated on `customers:manage` and
  answering `cartApprovalPolicyResponseSchema` — the same code and the same shape as the
  `PATCH` that has been there since feature 027. `CartApprovalService` gains `getPolicyByAdmin`.
  The contribution reads its own initial state through that route instead of taking the
  `initialRequiresCartApproval` prop the old panel took, because a zone's props cannot carry a
  value only one of four contributors wants.

  That panel had been imported by nothing, and the copy it rendered was in no bundle under any
  spelling — `t('carts.policy.title')` under the `carts` namespace resolves to
  `bundle['carts']['carts.policy.title']`, which never existed. Ten `policy.*` keys are added to
  this package's own bundle in both shipped languages, and the capability reaches an operator
  for the first time.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-price-lists` and `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels` each gain a
  second contribution over a component they already ship, and each loses its duplicate:
  `DisplayModeOverrideRow` and `EntityChannelMembership` existed twice in the tree for the
  length of the previous release, because the organization detail screen still imported the
  `admin/src` copy. Both copies are gone and nothing imports them.

  **Operator-visible copy change.** The organization detail's pricing card is now
  `price_lists`' own: the screen used to pass `organizations.detail.pricingLabel` and
  `organizations.detail.pricingHint` into a control it does not own and wrap it in a card
  titled `organizations.detail.pricingCard`. A host cannot hand copy to a contributor it does
  not know, so the control renders `priceLists.displayMode.rowLabel` and its own hint, and all
  three host keys are removed from the `core` bundle in both languages. Two further `core` keys
  go with them — `priceLists.linked.displayModeLabel` and `priceLists.linked.displayModeHint`,
  which the previous release left unread.

  No contribution declares a `match`, and each says why in its own file: `match` narrows the
  mounts of one place, and each of these members has one host and one mount. Every zone test
  asserts it absent.

### Patch Changes

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.

- 98ef35e: `carts` declares the three error codes it owns, and the seven refusal tokens under one of them.

  The module's `manifest.ts` gains an `errorCodes` array
  (`specs/090-module-owned-error-codes/`, Phase 3), which is what routes each code's translated
  sentence to this package's own `i18n/{en,pl}.json` under `errors.<CODE>`. No exported symbol
  changes shape and no sentence moves: the list is exactly what the platform's incumbent prefix
  chain routes here today, so a consumer sees the identical envelope for `CART_EMPTY`,
  `CART_LINE_CAP_EXCEEDED` and `CART_COUPON_REJECTED`.

  `CART_COUPON_REJECTED` is the first declaration in the migration to carry `tokens` — the seven
  `errors.CART_COUPON_REJECTED.<token>` discriminators the envelope reads from `details.code`.
  They are the members of `couponDropReasonSchema` in `@endora-commerce/contracts`, which is the
  type of the value the raise site produces, rather than the seven keys the bundle happens to hold.
