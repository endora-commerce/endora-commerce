# @endora-commerce/mod-taxes

## 0.7.0

### Major Changes

- 69261b8: `taxes` declares `taxes:read` and `taxes:write`, and its admin routes enforce them instead of
  `catalog:write`.

  **Breaking for anyone whose roles reach this module's admin API.** All four routes moved, and
  unlike the three modules that preceded it, every one of them was gated on the catalogue's
  **write** code — there was no read gate to move:

  ```
  GET    /api/v1/admin/taxes           catalog:write -> taxes:read
  GET    /api/v1/admin/taxes/preview   catalog:write -> taxes:read
  PUT    /api/v1/admin/taxes/:code     catalog:write -> taxes:write
  DELETE /api/v1/admin/taxes/:id       catalog:write -> taxes:write
  ```

  So `taxes:read` is a capability that did not exist before rather than a rename of one: an
  operator can now be shown a VAT rate without being handed the authority to change it. Grant it
  alone for a finance or support role; grant the pair to configure rates.

  Nothing that _computes_ tax is affected. `orders`, `carts`, `product_feeds` and `quote_requests`
  resolve a rate through the `taxService` port in process; these routes serve the admin
  configuration screen and nothing else.

  There is no data migration and that is deliberate: granting the new codes to every holder of
  `catalog:write` would reproduce the distribution the change exists to remove, which would make it
  a change of spelling rather than of authority. A role that was configuring tax rules through the
  catalogue code is granted `taxes:read` / `taxes:write` on `/admin-roles`, where the manifest puts
  them automatically.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n` carries the two `adminRoles.permission.taxes:*` labels and the
  screen's refusal notice, in `en` and `pl`.

### Minor Changes

- 196fbfa: Six modules ship their admin surfaces, and the delivery-methods list becomes a zone its
  carriers contribute to.

  **New `./admin` subpath on six packages.** `@endora-commerce/mod-seo`,
  `mod-taxes`, `mod-credit-limits`, `mod-delivery-methods`, `mod-megamenu` and `mod-returns`
  each export `contributions` — an `AdminContributions` object — from
  `@endora-commerce/mod-<id>/admin`. Every component is a dynamic-import factory, so a
  consumer's bundler emits one chunk per screen. The routes are unchanged: `/seo`, `/taxes`,
  `/credit-limits`, `/delivery-methods`, `/megamenu` plus `/megamenu/:id`, and `/returns`
  plus its four sub-screens.

  Three things a consumer has to know about that half:
  - **The subpath needs a build.** `./admin` resolves at `dist/admin/index.js`, emitted by
    each package's new `tsconfig.ui.json`; a checkout that has not run
    `pnpm run build:packages` cannot resolve it.
  - **`@endora-commerce/admin-kit` and `react` become peer dependencies of all six.** The kit
    is where every screen's design-system import resolves, and `react` is peered rather than
    depended on so the application resolves one copy.
  - **Each package now ships an `i18n/` bundle carrying its own `nav.*.label`.** The sidebar
    label is module-relative — `nav.seo.label`, `nav.taxes.label`, `nav.creditLimits.label`,
    `nav.deliveryMethods.label`, `nav.megamenu.label`, `nav.returns.label` — resolved in the
    module's own namespace instead of the shared `core` one.

  **New in `@endora-commerce/contracts`:**
  - `AdminZoneNameSchema` gains `'delivery_method.list.integrations'`, the first member whose
    host is not the product editor, with `DeliveryMethodIntegrationsZoneProps` (empty: the
    host renders one card per shipping integration and has no identifier to name one by) and
    its `AdminZonePropsMap` entry.
  - `KnownIconNameSchema` gains `'Newspaper'`, which `megamenu`'s sidebar entry names now
    that it declares its own row rather than importing the glyph.

  **New in `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`:** `DeliveryMethodIntegrationsZoneProps` is re-exported
  from `./contributions`, and `resolveIcon('Newspaper')` answers.

  **`mod-dhl-parcel` and `mod-inpost` each gain a zone contribution**, on the `./admin`
  subpath they already had:

  ```ts
  zoneComponent(
    'delivery_method.list.integrations',
    () => import('./zones/DeliveryMethodIntegrationCard.js'),
    {
      weight: 100,
      requiredPermission: 'dhl_parcel:read',
    },
  );
  ```

  `delivery_methods` used to render both cards itself, with each carrier's title, description,
  route and permission code written into its own file. A third carrier now needs no edit to a
  file its author does not own, and the presence gate, the permission gate and the ordering are
  the zone renderer's.

  Nothing is removed and no existing export changes shape, so a consumer of any package's
  `./backend`, `./migrations` or root subpath is unaffected.

- ad62954: Fourteen more modules become workspace packages (feature 080, T040b batch three):
  `autopay`, `comparisons`, `credentials`, `dictionaries`, `google_tag_manager`,
  `ksef`, `meta_ads`, `paypal`, `payu`, `quick_order`, `search`, `stripe`, `taxes`
  and `tpay`. Each ships `dist` and resolves through its own `exports` map — the
  root for its manifest, `./backend` for `registerModule` plus the `entities`
  array, `./migrations` for its migration classes — exactly as the twenty-nine
  packages before them.

  **For a consumer of `@endora-commerce/mod-ksef`, one export is new and
  load-bearing.** `KsefUnavailableError` is now published by name on `./backend`:

  ```ts
  import { KsefUnavailableError } from '@endora-commerce/mod-ksef/backend';
  ```

  Anything implementing `KsefApiClientPort` — an overlay's client, a test double,
  a second gateway — must throw **that** class for an outage.
  `classifySubmissionError` decides "retry" from `instanceof`, so a caller holding
  a constructor of its own, or the class from a relative import into this
  package's source, gets its outage classified as `UNEXPECTED`: the submission is
  parked for an operator instead of queued for the sweep, silently. There is no
  behaviour change for a caller that already throws the module's own class.

  Nothing else in any of the fourteen changed shape. The move is a relocation:
  same entities, same migrations, same class names, same tables. The committed
  migration registry's `(moduleId, className)` declaration sequence and its
  computed execution sequence are byte-identical to the merge base — 158 entries,
  `declaration=2db29d89…`, `execution=c794685f…` — because packaging changes no
  manifest `dependencies` and the order is a function of those.
