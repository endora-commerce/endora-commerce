## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- e27bf6c: Every package that ships scannable UI now publishes its own Tailwind `@source`
  declarations at a new `./tailwind.css` subpath.

  A host compiling this package's utility classes no longer has to know where the
  package's sources are. Import the subpath from the stylesheet that builds your
  admin, and the package names its own layers:

  ```css
  @import 'tailwindcss';
  @import '@endora-commerce/mod-blog/tailwind.css';
  ```

  `@source` resolves relative to the stylesheet that declares it, so the paths hold
  wherever the package is installed. The file is generated from the package's layer
  inventory, ships in the tarball beside `package.json`, and its `dist` line is the one
  that matters to you — the `src` line beside it is inert in a published package and
  exists so that a checkout of this repository keeps scanning source in `dev`.

  **Nothing is removed or renamed**: every existing subpath resolves exactly as before.
  What is new is the obligation on the _host_ side, and it is a build error rather than a
  silent one. Before this, a host reached these packages with a glob over the monorepo
  (`@source "../../packages/**"`), which named a directory no installed tree has —
  and Tailwind reports nothing at all about a source that matches nothing, so such a host
  built green and rendered every screen unstyled. A host that now names a package that is
  not installed gets `Can't resolve`, and one whose tarball omits the file gets
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.

  `@endora-commerce/cms-components` deliberately does **not** publish this subpath. It
  ships a finished, prefixed stylesheet at `./styles.css` and must not also be scanned by
  its host.

- 384f5e2: The module declares its demo data: `manifest.demo` creates the Polish standard VAT rule and
  withdraws it again.

  `endora demo seed` now reports `taxes` by name with the rule it created, and `endora demo
reset` removes it. Both bodies are reached by a relative `await import()` from the manifest,
  so nothing is loaded by the processes that merely compose the platform, and the module gained
  no `exports` subpath, no `files` entry and no manifest `dependencies` entry.

  **The withdrawal changed, and it is a repair.** The host's demo reset used to clear this table
  with a `truncate … cascade`, which cannot tell a demo rule from one an operator wrote. It now
  deletes only the code `seed` assigns (`pl_vat_23`), so an operator's own rules — and the
  sales-channel bindings that pointed at them — survive a demo reset.

  Seeding twice creates nothing the second time and reports the same count.

## 0.7.0

### Major Changes

- 69261b8: `taxes` declares `taxes:read` and `taxes:write`, and its admin routes enforce them instead of
  `catalog:write`.

  **Breaking for anyone whose roles reach this module's admin API.** All four routes moved, and
  unlike the three modules that preceded it, every one of them was gated on the catalogue's
  **write** code — there was no read gate to move:

  ```
  GET    /api/v1/admin/taxes           catalog:write -> taxes:read
  GET    /api/v1/admin/taxes/preview   catalog:write -> taxes:read
  PUT    /api/v1/admin/taxes/:code     catalog:write -> taxes:write
  DELETE /api/v1/admin/taxes/:id       catalog:write -> taxes:write
  ```

  So `taxes:read` is a capability that did not exist before rather than a rename of one: an
  operator can now be shown a VAT rate without being handed the authority to change it. Grant it
  alone for a finance or support role; grant the pair to configure rates.

  Nothing that _computes_ tax is affected. `orders`, `carts`, `product_feeds` and `quote_requests`
  resolve a rate through the `taxService` port in process; these routes serve the admin
  configuration screen and nothing else.

  There is no data migration and that is deliberate: granting the new codes to every holder of
  `catalog:write` would reproduce the distribution the change exists to remove, which would make it
  a change of spelling rather than of authority. A role that was configuring tax rules through the
  catalogue code is granted `taxes:read` / `taxes:write` on `/admin-roles`, where the manifest puts
  them automatically.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n` carries the two `adminRoles.permission.taxes:*` labels and the
  screen's refusal notice, in `en` and `pl`.

### Minor Changes

- 196fbfa: Six modules ship their admin surfaces, and the delivery-methods list becomes a zone its
  carriers contribute to.

  **New `./admin` subpath on six packages.** `@endora-commerce/mod-seo`,
  `mod-taxes`, `mod-credit-limits`, `mod-delivery-methods`, `mod-megamenu` and `mod-returns`
  each export `contributions` — an `AdminContributions` object — from
  `@endora-commerce/mod-<id>/admin`. Every component is a dynamic-import factory, so a
  consumer's bundler emits one chunk per screen. The routes are unchanged: `/seo`, `/taxes`,
  `/credit-limits`, `/delivery-methods`, `/megamenu` plus `/megamenu/:id`, and `/returns`
  plus its four sub-screens.

  Three things a consumer has to know about that half:
  - **The subpath needs a build.** `./admin` resolves at `dist/admin/index.js`, emitted by
    each package's new `tsconfig.ui.json`; a checkout that has not run
    `pnpm run build:packages` cannot resolve it.
  - **`@endora-commerce/admin-kit` and `react` become peer dependencies of all six.** The kit
    is where every screen's design-system import resolves, and `react` is peered rather than
    depended on so the application resolves one copy.
  - **Each package now ships an `i18n/` bundle carrying its own `nav.*.label`.** The sidebar
    label is module-relative — `nav.seo.label`, `nav.taxes.label`, `nav.creditLimits.label`,
    `nav.deliveryMethods.label`, `nav.megamenu.label`, `nav.returns.label` — resolved in the
    module's own namespace instead of the shared `core` one.

  **New in `@endora-commerce/contracts`:**
  - `AdminZoneNameSchema` gains `'delivery_method.list.integrations'`, the first member whose
    host is not the product editor, with `DeliveryMethodIntegrationsZoneProps` (empty: the
    host renders one card per shipping integration and has no identifier to name one by) and
    its `AdminZonePropsMap` entry.
  - `KnownIconNameSchema` gains `'Newspaper'`, which `megamenu`'s sidebar entry names now
    that it declares its own row rather than importing the glyph.

  **New in `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`:** `DeliveryMethodIntegrationsZoneProps` is re-exported
  from `./contributions`, and `resolveIcon('Newspaper')` answers.

  **`mod-dhl-parcel` and `mod-inpost` each gain a zone contribution**, on the `./admin`
  subpath they already had:

  ```ts
  zoneComponent(
    'delivery_method.list.integrations',
    () => import('./zones/DeliveryMethodIntegrationCard.js'),
    {
      weight: 100,
      requiredPermission: 'dhl_parcel:read',
    },
  );
  ```

  `delivery_methods` used to render both cards itself, with each carrier's title, description,
  route and permission code written into its own file. A third carrier now needs no edit to a
  file its author does not own, and the presence gate, the permission gate and the ordering are
  the zone renderer's.

  Nothing is removed and no existing export changes shape, so a consumer of any package's
  `./backend`, `./migrations` or root subpath is unaffected.

- ad62954: Fourteen more modules become workspace packages (feature 080, T040b batch three):
  `autopay`, `comparisons`, `credentials`, `dictionaries`, `google_tag_manager`,
  `ksef`, `meta_ads`, `paypal`, `payu`, `quick_order`, `search`, `stripe`, `taxes`
  and `tpay`. Each ships `dist` and resolves through its own `exports` map — the
  root for its manifest, `./backend` for `registerModule` plus the `entities`
  array, `./migrations` for its migration classes — exactly as the twenty-nine
  packages before them.

  **For a consumer of `@endora-commerce/mod-ksef`, one export is new and
  load-bearing.** `KsefUnavailableError` is now published by name on `./backend`:

  ```ts
  import { KsefUnavailableError } from '@endora-commerce/mod-ksef/backend';
  ```

  Anything implementing `KsefApiClientPort` — an overlay's client, a test double,
  a second gateway — must throw **that** class for an outage.
  `classifySubmissionError` decides "retry" from `instanceof`, so a caller holding
  a constructor of its own, or the class from a relative import into this
  package's source, gets its outage classified as `UNEXPECTED`: the submission is
  parked for an operator instead of queued for the sweep, silently. There is no
  behaviour change for a caller that already throws the module's own class.

  Nothing else in any of the fourteen changed shape. The move is a relocation:
  same entities, same migrations, same class names, same tables. The committed
  migration registry's `(moduleId, className)` declaration sequence and its
  computed execution sequence are byte-identical to the merge base — 158 entries,
  `declaration=2db29d89…`, `execution=c794685f…` — because packaging changes no
  manifest `dependencies` and the order is a function of those.
