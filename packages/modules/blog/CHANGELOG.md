## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 8f61a6b: Every published package now ships its own `LICENSE` and `README.md`.

  npm force-includes a file named `LICENSE` into the tarball exactly as it does `README.md`,
  whatever `files` says, so the text has to be in the package directory and not only at the
  repository root — `LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md` states that rule and, until this release, no package
  obeyed it. Measured on `master`: **0** of the 82 publishable packages carried a `LICENSE` and
  **14** carried a `README.md`, so every tarball shipped without licence text and 68 registry
  pages would have rendered empty.

  Both files are **generated**, by `pnpm --filter backend run manifests:generate`, and refused
  when stale by `manifests:check` in the `quality` job:
  - the `LICENSE` is the repository's root `LICENSE`, copied verbatim — the same single source
    the `license: MIT` field is already rendered from. A package that declares a licence of its
    own in the `SEE LICENSE IN <file>` form is skipped and keeps the file it names.
  - the `README.md` is rendered from what the package's own manifest declares: its description,
    its module id where it has one, every published subpath with what that layer holds, its peer
    dependencies with the optional ones marked, the locales its `i18n/` carries and what the
    tarball ships. A `README.md` **without** the generated marker on its first line is a human's
    and is never rewritten — the fourteen that existed are untouched.

  Five module packages also get their npm description back. `@endora-commerce/mod-blog`,
  `mod-credit-limits`, `mod-dhl-parcel`, `mod-google-analytics` and `mod-quote-requests` carried
  the note written when they were moved out of `backend/src/modules` — _"the first module to
  leave backend/src/modules … the manifest id stays identity of record"_ — as the sentence a
  registry shows under the package name. Each now carries the sentence its own module manifest
  declares, which is where `descriptionFor` seeds one from in the first place.

  No API changes, no new dependency, no behaviour change: what moves is what the tarball carries
  and what a package page says.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 0eeb9b5: Require Node >= 22.18.0.

  The previous floor was 22.17.0, which MikroORM 7 sets. 22.18.0 is the first release that
  strips TypeScript types without a flag, and that is what loads a deployment's overlay module:
  in a scaffolded instance `apps/` is outside every compiled member, so the unit the platform
  `import()`s is the client's own `.ts`. On 22.17.x that import throws
  `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` and the process dies before it listens. Emitting a `.js` beside
  the client's source was measured and refused — the overlay loader resolves `.js` before `.ts`
  while the divergence derivation admits both, so the sibling doubles every seam site in the
  report.

  Derived by probing 22.17.0, 22.17.1, 22.18.0 and 22.19.0 against a `.ts` module imported with
  no flag; 22.18.0 is the lowest that loads it.

  If you run 22.17.x, upgrade to 22.18 or later. Nothing else in these packages changed.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- e27bf6c: Every package that ships scannable UI now publishes its own Tailwind `@source`
  declarations at a new `./tailwind.css` subpath.

  A host compiling this package's utility classes no longer has to know where the
  package's sources are. Import the subpath from the stylesheet that builds your
  admin, and the package names its own layers:

  ```css
  @import 'tailwindcss';
  @import '@endora-commerce/mod-blog/tailwind.css';
  ```

  `@source` resolves relative to the stylesheet that declares it, so the paths hold
  wherever the package is installed. The file is generated from the package's layer
  inventory, ships in the tarball beside `package.json`, and its `dist` line is the one
  that matters to you — the `src` line beside it is inert in a published package and
  exists so that a checkout of this repository keeps scanning source in `dev`.

  **Nothing is removed or renamed**: every existing subpath resolves exactly as before.
  What is new is the obligation on the _host_ side, and it is a build error rather than a
  silent one. Before this, a host reached these packages with a glob over the monorepo
  (`@source "../../packages/**"`), which named a directory no installed tree has —
  and Tailwind reports nothing at all about a source that matches nothing, so such a host
  built green and rendered every screen unstyled. A host that now names a package that is
  not installed gets `Can't resolve`, and one whose tarball omits the file gets
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.

  `@endora-commerce/cms-components` deliberately does **not** publish this subpath. It
  ships a finished, prefixed stylesheet at `./styles.css` and must not also be scanned by
  its host.

## 0.7.0

### Major Changes

- bd79430: **Breaking:** `@endora-commerce/mod-blog/backend` no longer exports any entity class by name.
  It exports one `entities` array instead (D-168).

  ```ts
  // before — eleven names, one per class
  import { BlogPost, BlogCategory } from '@endora-commerce/mod-blog/backend';

  // after — there is no replacement, and that is the point
  import { entities } from '@endora-commerce/mod-blog/backend';
  // entities: readonly [BlogCategory, BlogCategoryLanguage, BlogCategorySalesChannel,
  //   BlogPost, BlogPostCategory, BlogPostLanguage, BlogPostRelatedPost,
  //   BlogPostRelatedProduct, BlogPostSalesChannel, BlogPostTag, BlogTag]
  ```

  The array is the value a host's ORM registers, and it is what this package's consumers actually
  need: `configured-entities.ts` merges it into the entity set, and nothing else can usefully
  name an entity class. If you were importing one as a **type**, you were reaching into another
  module's internals — reach for the shape in `@endora-commerce/contracts` instead
  (`BlogPostDetail`, `BlogPostSummary`, `BlogCategoryTreeNode`, …), which is the published
  contract for every one of these rows. If you were relating to one with a MikroORM decorator,
  that was already forbidden (`check:kernel-boundary`, D-32).

  **Also fixed, and it was worse:** `@endora-commerce/mod-blog/migrations` now exports a
  `migrations` array beside the migration class it already named. It published only
  `export * from './20260506T081055_blog_init.js'`, and the platform's package loader refuses a
  `./migrations` export that declares no such array — so **an installed copy of this package
  stopped the host from booting**, with
  `the "./migrations" export of @endora-commerce/mod-blog exports no 'migrations' array`. The
  class name is unchanged, so no database sees a migration it has already applied as pending.

  Neither defect was reachable from this repository, which is why both shipped: a workspace
  member is linked rather than installed, and the host's committed entity registry imported the
  eleven classes directly. Packed into a tarball and installed into an instance — the way the
  package is actually consumed — the module registered **zero** entities, silently, once the
  migrations barrel stopped refusing the package outright.

### Minor Changes

- 59c59c6: `cms` and `blog` ship their admin screens, and `cms` publishes its page-builder canvas.

  **Two packages' `./admin` subpath is new, and `@endora-commerce/mod-cms` gains a second UI
  subpath.** Eighteen routes and seven sidebar entries between them, at the paths the
  hand-written host registrations carried, plus `./admin-ui` on `cms` for the one component
  another module renders. The exported symbol on `./admin` is the same one every other module
  package uses — `contributions`, an `AdminContributions` object, and nothing else.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-cms` — **new `./admin` subpath**, exporting `contributions`. Eleven
    routes: `/cms` and `/cms/pages` (the landing route) on `cms.read`, `/cms/pages/:id`,
    `/cms/blocks`, `/cms/blocks/:id`, `/cms/templates`, `/cms/templates/:id` and `/cms/hooks`
    on `cms.read`, and `/cms/pages/new`, `/cms/blocks/new` and `/cms/templates/new` on
    **`cms.write`**. `/cms` is a second declaration of the page list rather than a redirect,
    because a redirect would be the consuming application's route and not this module's. Four
    sidebar rows, in the `content` section at weights 100 to 400.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-blog` — **new `./admin` subpath**, exporting `contributions`. Seven
    routes: `/blog/posts` (the landing route), `/blog/posts/:id`, `/blog/categories`,
    `/blog/categories/:id` and `/blog/tags` on `blog.read`, and `/blog/posts/new` and
    `/blog/categories/new` on **`blog.write`**. Three sidebar rows, in the `content` section at
    weights 600 to 800.

  **The five create routes take the write code, and that is a behaviour change for a consumer
  rendering these routes.** Each create screen exists to write — `POST /api/v1/admin/cms/pages`
  and its four siblings enforce the write code — and each module's own palette action
  (`new-page`, `new-post`) already advertised that code. The routes were ungated while they
  belonged to the admin application, so a read-only operator could open a form whose save then
  refused. The five create controls are gated on the same code in this release — the _New page_,
  _New block_, _New template_, _New post_ and _New category_ buttons and the category tree's
  _+ Child_ — so the dead end is closed at both ends. `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels`
  ships the identical split for `/sales-channels/new` and `@endora-commerce/mod-credentials` for
  `/credentials/new`.

  **`CategoryTreeNode` takes a new required prop.** It is not exported from any subpath, so this
  affects nobody outside the package; it is recorded because the prop is `canCreate: boolean`
  and required rather than optional — a caller that forgets it does not compile, which is the
  direction a permission gate has to fail in.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-cms` — new `./admin-ui` subpath, exporting `PageBuilderEditor` and the
  `PageBuilderData` type.** This is the Puck canvas the CMS page, block and template editors
  render and that `@endora-commerce/mod-blog`'s post and category editors render too. Its props
  are `data` in and `onChange` back, so the consumer decides that it appears — a published
  component rather than something the owner contributes to a place of its own choosing. It is
  not in `@endora-commerce/admin-kit` because it is a `@measured/puck` host and the kit is what
  every module's admin layer compiles against, and not in
  `@endora-commerce/page-builder-admin` because it calls this module's API client, reads this
  module's translation namespace and lays the CMS page container out — that package holds the
  builder chrome that names no module at all.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-blog` gains `@endora-commerce/mod-cms` as a peer dependency**, which
  is what a published component costs: the reach survives into the emitted JavaScript, so a
  consumer bundling `blog`'s admin layer must resolve `cms`. It is not a `dependency` — a module
  reaches another through a port declared in its manifest, never through npm — and it is not
  optional. A consumer that installs `@endora-commerce/mod-blog` without `@endora-commerce/mod-cms`
  will fail to resolve `@endora-commerce/mod-cms/admin-ui` at bundle time. There is no runtime
  half to worry about: `blog`'s module manifest already declares `cms` in its `dependencies`, so
  a platform where `cms` is absent or switched off is one where `blog` cannot be activated
  either.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-cms` and `@endora-commerce/mod-blog` ship new i18n keys, and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n` loses seven.** `nav.cmsPages.label`, `nav.cmsBlocks.label`,
  `nav.cmsTemplates.label`, `nav.cmsHooks.label`, `nav.blogPosts.label`,
  `nav.blogCategories.label` and `nav.blogTags.label` are in the two modules' own
  `i18n/{en,pl}.json`; `appShell.nav.cmsPages`, `appShell.nav.cmsBlocks`,
  `appShell.nav.cmsTemplates`, `appShell.nav.cmsHooks`, `appShell.nav.blogPosts`,
  `appShell.nav.blogCategories` and `appShell.nav.blogTags` are removed from the shared bundle
  in both shipped languages, nothing rendering them any more. **A consumer resolving one of
  those seven keys out of the `core` namespace will get a raw key**; each has a
  module-namespaced replacement above.

  **Neither module declares a new palette action, and neither loses one.** `cms` has declared
  `new-page` and `blog` `new-post` all along, and the admin application's own palette table
  never carried a hand-written row for either — so unlike batches 10, 13 and 14 there was
  nothing to convert.

- f66359f: The stored Page Builder block names are namespaced, once, by five migrations.

  Each of the five table-owning modules rewrites **its own** columns — `cms` three, `blog`
  two, `transactional_emails` three, `newsletter` two, `invoices` one — with a recursive
  `pg_temp` function generated from `FROZEN_BLOCK_RENAMES`. A migration belongs to the module
  that owns the **table**, never to the module that owns the new name, so no new manifest
  `dependencies` edge arises: a block name is a string value inside a JSONB document, not a
  foreign key.

  The rewrite is **structural**: it replaces the value of a `type` property in a node position
  and nothing else. Twelve of the 74 names are ordinary English words (`Row`, `Text`, `Image`,
  `Map`, `Button`, …) that occur throughout shop content, so a textual substitution would
  corrupt a `RawHtml` block's markup and every `alt` attribute in the shop.

  It is **idempotent by construction** — every key of the map is bare and every value is
  dotted, so a second run finds nothing — and it **cannot fail on its input**: a name the map
  does not hold is left byte-identical and reported, never quarantined. `down()` applies the
  inverse over the identical walk.

  `cms` gains an operator command for the pre-flight:

  ```
  pnpm --filter backend run cli -- cms block-names
  ```

  Read-only, across all eleven columns, classifying every stored name as _will be renamed →
  new name_, _already namespaced_ or _unrecognised_. Run it before upgrading, resolve or accept
  the unrecognised set, take a backup, upgrade, and run it again: every _will be renamed_
  becomes _already namespaced_ and the unrecognised set is unchanged.

  `catalog`, `orders` and `ksef` are patch-bumped because their block declarations are now what
  the registry serves — the eight `catalog` blocks, the eight `orders` ones and
  `ksef.InvoiceSection` were previously registered as `cms`' and `invoices`'.

- 6a9ae1d: New package: the Blog module, the first to leave `backend/src/modules/` (feature 080, T040b).

  It publishes three subpaths and no root wildcard, and every one of them serves compiled
  output (D-164):
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-blog` — the manifest. Isomorphic, `@endora-commerce/contracts` its
    only import, and the file the generated manifest index reads the module's identity,
    permissions, palette actions and activation control from.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-blog/backend` — `registerModule(ctx)` plus the `entities` array the
    host's ORM registry spreads (see `blog-entities-array-d168.md`; this file described the
    eleven `@Entity()` classes as named exports, which they no longer are).
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-blog/migrations` — the `migrations` array the platform's package loader
    reads, and `Migration20260506T081055BlogInit` by name for the host's migration registry.

  `@endora-commerce/platform` is a `peerDependency` (D-160.2), and so are `@mikro-orm/*`,
  `fastify`, `ioredis` and `zod`. The package holds one copy of nothing: it resolves the host
  through the same `exports` map the application does, which is what keeps `HttpError`,
  `SalesChannel` and `effectiveState` single in the process.

  The manifest id stays `blog` — it is identity of record for the lifecycle registry, the
  settings store, the permission codes, the i18n bundle paths and the migration ownership
  (D-142). The npm name is only how npm keeps names unique.

### Patch Changes

- 54587bf: `blog` declares the nineteen error codes it owns.

  `manifest.ts` gains an `errorCodes` array — feature 090 Phase 3
  (`specs/090-module-owned-error-codes/`). Nothing the package exports changes
  shape. The observable difference for a consumer is that this module's error
  sentences are now routed by its own declaration rather than only by the prefix
  chain in `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`, which continues to answer identically for
  every one of them: the list is the chain's own answer, copied verbatim from the
  frozen capture, and is asserted equal to it in both directions.

  All nineteen already carry a written sentence in both `en` and `pl` in this
  package's own `i18n/` bundles, so no sentence moves and none is added. No
  `tokens`: no code this module raises passes a `details.code` discriminator.

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.
