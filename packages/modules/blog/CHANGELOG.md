## 0.104.0

### Minor Changes

- 9d6dfbc: Every Page Builder editor is laid out the same way: the blog post, blog category and
  transactional e-mail editors join the CMS ones.

  **`@endora-commerce/page-builder-admin` publishes the editor shell.** New exports on `.`:
  `PageBuilderEditorLayout`, `usePageBuilderEditorSettingsPanel`,
  `PAGE_BUILDER_EDITOR_SETTINGS_STORAGE_KEY`, `PAGE_BUILDER_EDITOR_TWO_COLUMN_MIN_WIDTH` and the
  types `PageBuilderEditorLayoutProps` and `PageBuilderEditorSettingsPanel`. It is the layout the CMS
  editors already have — canvas as the main column, the entity's cards in a settings panel that is a
  column beside it from 1800 px, a block above it below that, collapsed by default there, always open
  for a new entity, revealed when a save is refused, the choice remembered per browser — moved out of
  `cms` so that a module does not have to depend on `cms` to lay out an editor. Three shapes: with a
  settings panel; without one (`settings` omitted — the canvas has the page); and `builder={null}`
  for an entity that has no canvas yet, where the cards are the page and nothing collapses. Its four
  strings are `pageBuilder.editorLayout.*` in the `core` bundle (`@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`).

  **Blog post and blog category editors.** The Page Builder is the main column and the fields are in
  the settings panel, grouped: Metadata, Scope, Search engines (SEO), then for a post Tags, Related
  posts, Related products and Lifecycle. **One Save replaces "Save metadata" and "Save content" /
  "Save description"**: it is in the header with "Save and exit", sends the same requests (the fields,
  then the canvas only if it was edited), and a save that cannot go through names what is missing and
  opens the panel instead of leaving a disabled button. Publish / Unpublish moved to the header;
  Archive is in the Lifecycle card. The canvas now follows the language tab, and saving tags or
  related content no longer puts the stored content back under unsaved canvas edits. A new post or
  category, which has no canvas until it exists, shows the fields as the page. `mod-blog` gains
  `@endora-commerce/page-builder-admin` as an optional peer dependency, next to the
  `@endora-commerce/mod-cms` one it already had. Removed bundle keys: `common.saveContent`,
  `common.saveDescription`, `common.saveMetadata`, `messages.contentSaved`,
  `messages.descriptionSaved`.

  **Transactional e-mail, e-mail block and e-mail template editors.** The canvas takes the full
  editor width and starts on the first screen; the scope, the language and the subject sit on one row
  above it instead of in three stacked cards. These editors deliberately have **no** settings panel:
  those fields say which message is on the canvas or are part of it. Their labels and messages are
  now translated (`pl` included) instead of hard-coded English. A save without a subject is refused
  on the screen, with a sentence that names the field and the cursor put in it, instead of the API's
  generic validation error; `EmailSubjectWithVariables` (`@endora-commerce/page-builder-admin/email`)
  gains the optional `invalid` and `describedBy` props that carry it.

  **`mod-cms`**: no visible change. Its three editors import the shell from
  `@endora-commerce/page-builder-admin`; the `editorLayout.*` keys left its bundle for `core`. The
  shell was never exported from `cms` (`./admin-ui` still publishes only `PageBuilderEditor`), so no
  import breaks. The remembered choice keeps its storage slot, `b2b-admin.cms-editor.settings-panel`,
  so operators who already chose keep their choice — and it now applies to the blog editors too.
  One behaviour differs: when a refused save opens the panel, the page scrolls to the top of the
  editor, so the message is on screen with the fields under it, rather than to the panel alone.

  No request, response or payload shape changed.

### Patch Changes

- 5e2ade8: Saving content in the Admin UI now reaches the storefront on the next request. Until now a saved CMS
  page, block, template or hook — and an edited megamenu — appeared only after the storefront's own
  60-second cache window, and the **Cache** screen could not shorten that: it cleared Redis, which the
  save had already done, and never told the storefront.

  - **`@endora-commerce/contracts`** exports the cache-tag vocabulary both sides must spell alike:
    `CMS_STOREFRONT_CACHE_TAGS`, `MEGAMENU_STOREFRONT_CACHE_TAG`, the event name
    `CMS_CONTENT_CHANGED_EVENT` (`cms.content_changed.v1`) and its payload type `CmsContentChange`.
    The tag strings are the ones the storefront already used, with one addition: the published-page
    index (the sitemap's source) is tagged `cms:page-index` instead of `cms:page`.
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-cms`** publishes `cms.content_changed.v1` on the EventBus after every page,
    block, template and hook write has committed, and answers it by posting the matching tags to the
    storefront's `/api/revalidate`. A block save now also drops the cached hooks that inline that
    block, which it did not before.
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-megamenu`** revalidates the `megamenu` tag on every menu write, and
    subscribes to `cms.content_changed.v1` so a saved block or page drops the menus that embed or link
    to it.
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-blog`** drops its cache when a category is created and when a tag is
    renamed without a code change; both used to leave the old listing in place for five minutes.
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-settings`** — clearing the `cms` or `megamenu` namespace on the Cache
    screen, or with `settings cache-clear`, now revalidates the storefront's copy too.

  Nothing to configure beyond what an instance already sets: revalidation runs when
  `STOREFRONT_BASE_URL` and `REVALIDATE_SECRET` are present on the backend and the same secret is on
  the storefront, is skipped otherwise, and never fails a save when the storefront cannot be reached.

  **An existing storefront tree** keeps working — its tags are the same strings — with one exception
  worth taking: change the tag on its `getCmsPageIndex` fetch from `cms:page` to
  `CMS_STOREFRONT_CACHE_TAGS.pageIndex`, or a newly published page reaches `sitemap.xml` only when the
  60-second window runs out.

## 0.102.0

### Minor Changes

- 255b60b: The page builder's editor peer moves from `@measured/puck` to `@puckeditor/core`. Puck renamed
  its package at 0.21 (`npm install @measured/puck` now prints _"Puck has moved"_), and these
  packages now import `@puckeditor/core` 0.23 — the code, the types and the stylesheet
  (`@puckeditor/core/puck.css`).

  **What a consumer changes.** If your project declares the editor itself — an admin application
  that bundles `@endora-commerce/page-builder-admin`, `@endora-commerce/mod-cms` or any of the
  modules above, or a storefront rendering pages through `@endora-commerce/cms-components`:

  ```bash
  pnpm remove @measured/puck
  pnpm add @puckeditor/core@^0.23.0
  ```

  and rename the specifier in any import of your own (`'@measured/puck'` → `'@puckeditor/core'`,
  `'@measured/puck/puck.css'` → `'@puckeditor/core/puck.css'`). A project scaffolded with
  `create-endora-commerce` / `endora new instance` gets the new name at its root from this release
  on; an existing instance renames the one line in its root `package.json`. Leaving
  `@measured/puck` installed does not satisfy the peer — the two names are different packages —
  so a bundler resolves `@puckeditor/core` to nothing and the editor fails to build.

  **Stored content is unchanged.** Puck 0.21–0.23 changed no part of the page data shape: CMS
  pages, blocks, templates, blog bodies, e-mail templates, newsletter blocks and invoice templates
  persisted under 0.20 render and edit as they did, with no migration and no read-time adapter.

  **The editor looks and behaves as it did.** Three 0.21–0.23 defaults that reshape the editor are
  pinned back for every builder host through new exports of `@endora-commerce/page-builder-core/editor`:
  `withPuckLegacySideBar(plugins)` keeps the stacked Components + Outline side bar instead of the
  0.21 Plugin Rail, `PUCK_LEGACY_VIEWPORTS` keeps the 0.20 Small / Medium / Large viewports without
  the 0.21 full-width one (the CMS host keeps passing its own breakpoints), and `PUCK_LEGACY_DND`
  keeps the 0.20 fluid drag-and-drop instead of the 0.23 insertion line. A host of your own built on
  these packages can pass the same three to its `<Puck>`.

  `@puckeditor/core` 0.23 requires Node 20 or later, below this platform's own floor (22.17).

### Patch Changes

- 489a0b6: Documentation: migrations are now named by the file that actually ships. The pages cited
  migrations by a retired numbering (`024_settings_init.ts`, "migration 102", `080_returns_init.ts`
  and others), which matches no file in any package. Each reference now gives the real
  timestamped filename, such as `20260611T140346_catalog_product_value_overrides_init.ts`, and
  says which module owns it where that is a different module. The organizations page also no
  longer claims that the `suspended` → `blocked` migration writes an audit-log entry: it writes
  an explanatory `blocked_reason` on each remapped row.

## 0.101.1

### Patch Changes

- 69a3717: The `fastify` peer is now `^5.11.0` instead of `^5`, so an install can no longer resolve Fastify 5.0–5.10. On those versions an async route handler that calls `reply.send()` without `return` throws `ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT` as an uncaught exception from Fastify's onSend hook runner, and the process crash-loops; Fastify 5.11.0 catches that error and the server keeps running. An instance scaffolded by `endora new instance` now declares `fastify@^5.11.0` as well. Nothing to do on upgrade unless your project pins Fastify below 5.11 — move it to `^5.11.0` (the repository itself runs 5.12.5).

## 0.101.0

### Patch Changes

- 5749604: Endora Commerce can be served from **one host with paths** — the storefront at `/`, the admin under `/admin`, the API under `/api` — as well as from one address per component.

  `@endora-commerce/cli`
  - **`endora install --public-url <origin>`** selects that layout. It stands for `--api-url <origin>`, `--storefront-url <origin>` and `--admin-url <origin>/admin`, each applied where the run has a use for it (so it works with `--only` on each machine in turn), and is refused beside any of the three. The API's address in this layout is the host itself — its routes already begin with `/api/v1` — so `--api-url` and `--storefront-url` still refuse a path, and now say why.
  - **`--admin-url` accepts a base path** after its origin (`https://example.com/admin`, or any other plain path; no trailing slash, query or fragment) and is accepted by a run that stands the admin up without the API, where it used to be refused. The path is written as `ADMIN_BASE_PATH=<path>/` into `admin/.env`.
  - **The scaffolded `admin/vite.config.ts` reads `ADMIN_BASE_PATH` as Vite's `base`** (default `/`). An instance scaffolded before this release gets the same by adding `base: env['ADMIN_BASE_PATH'] || '/'` to its own configuration.
  - With the API in the run, `ADMIN_BASE_URL` is the admin's whole address, path included, and `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` holds origins, each once. A port in an origin two components share is the proxy's, and is no longer written as either component's `PORT`.
  - The wizard, for a run that stands up only some components, asks how the three are reached before it asks any address: _one address each_, or _one address, with paths_ — which is then one question.
  - The closing block of such a run lists the routing the host owes: `/api/` and `/assets/file/` to the API unchanged, `/api/revalidate` exactly to the storefront, `/admin/` to the admin with its `index.html` as the fallback, everything else to the storefront.
  - **`deploy/nginx.paths.example.conf`** (single-host topology) is that routing for nginx, and `deploy/README.md` gains a section on it. `Dockerfile.admin` says how the image is built for a base path: a committed `admin/.env.production` holding `ADMIN_BASE_PATH=/admin/`.
  - **Both nginx examples forward `$http_host`** — the host with its port — as `Host` and `X-Forwarded-Host`, where they forwarded `$host`. Behind a proxy on any port but 80 or 443 the storefront refused every form submission (`x-forwarded-host … does not match origin`), because Next compares the two.
  - The storefront this CLI carries: its service worker leaves requests under `/admin` to the network, as it leaves `/api/`.

  `@endora-commerce/admin-shell`
  - **`AdminRoot` mounts its router under the bundle's base path.** New optional prop `basename`; by default it is derived from Vite's `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`, so a project built with `base: '/admin/'` gets a router under `/admin` with nothing else to set. With the default base nothing changes. New export `routerBasename(base)`.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-blog`, `@endora-commerce/mod-catalog`
  - Two admin screens linked with a raw absolute `href` (the _new category_ button of the blog category tree; the product links in the bulk-edit result list). Under a base path a raw `href` leaves the admin, and at the root it reloaded the application; both are the router's `Link` now.

  declares or depends on changes. `@endora-commerce/contracts` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-invoice-ledger` also carry a one-sentence rewording in an already-published
  `CHANGELOG.md` entry, with no change to what that entry says about the code.

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 8f61a6b: Every published package now ships its own `LICENSE` and `README.md`.

  npm force-includes a file named `LICENSE` into the tarball exactly as it does `README.md`,
  whatever `files` says, so the text has to be in the package directory and not only at the
  repository root — `LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md` states that rule and, until this release, no package
  obeyed it. Measured on `master`: **0** of the 82 publishable packages carried a `LICENSE` and
  **14** carried a `README.md`, so every tarball shipped without licence text and 68 registry
  pages would have rendered empty.

  Both files are **generated**, by `pnpm --filter backend run manifests:generate`, and refused
  when stale by `manifests:check` in the `quality` job:
  - the `LICENSE` is the repository's root `LICENSE`, copied verbatim — the same single source
    the `license: MIT` field is already rendered from. A package that declares a licence of its
    own in the `SEE LICENSE IN <file>` form is skipped and keeps the file it names.
  - the `README.md` is rendered from what the package's own manifest declares: its description,
    its module id where it has one, every published subpath with what that layer holds, its peer
    dependencies with the optional ones marked, the locales its `i18n/` carries and what the
    tarball ships. A `README.md` **without** the generated marker on its first line is a human's
    and is never rewritten — the fourteen that existed are untouched.

  Five module packages also get their npm description back. `@endora-commerce/mod-blog`,
  `mod-credit-limits`, `mod-dhl-parcel`, `mod-google-analytics` and `mod-quote-requests` carried
  the note written when they were moved out of `backend/src/modules` — _"the first module to
  leave backend/src/modules … the manifest id stays identity of record"_ — as the sentence a
  registry shows under the package name. Each now carries the sentence its own module manifest
  declares, which is where `descriptionFor` seeds one from in the first place.

  No API changes, no new dependency, no behaviour change: what moves is what the tarball carries
  and what a package page says.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 0eeb9b5: Require Node >= 22.18.0.

  The previous floor was 22.17.0, which MikroORM 7 sets. 22.18.0 is the first release that
  strips TypeScript types without a flag, and that is what loads a deployment's overlay module:
  in a scaffolded instance `apps/` is outside every compiled member, so the unit the platform
  `import()`s is the client's own `.ts`. On 22.17.x that import throws
  `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` and the process dies before it listens. Emitting a `.js` beside
  the client's source was measured and refused — the overlay loader resolves `.js` before `.ts`
  while the divergence derivation admits both, so the sibling doubles every seam site in the
  report.

  Derived by probing 22.17.0, 22.17.1, 22.18.0 and 22.19.0 against a `.ts` module imported with
  no flag; 22.18.0 is the lowest that loads it.

  If you run 22.17.x, upgrade to 22.18 or later. Nothing else in these packages changed.

### Minor Changes

- e27bf6c: Every package that ships scannable UI now publishes its own Tailwind `@source`
  declarations at a new `./tailwind.css` subpath.

  A host compiling this package's utility classes no longer has to know where the
  package's sources are. Import the subpath from the stylesheet that builds your
  admin, and the package names its own layers:

  ```css
  @import 'tailwindcss';
  @import '@endora-commerce/mod-blog/tailwind.css';
  ```

  `@source` resolves relative to the stylesheet that declares it, so the paths hold
  wherever the package is installed. The file is generated from the package's layer
  inventory, ships in the tarball beside `package.json`, and its `dist` line is the one
  that matters to you — the `src` line beside it is inert in a published package and
  exists so that a checkout of this repository keeps scanning source in `dev`.

  **Nothing is removed or renamed**: every existing subpath resolves exactly as before.
  What is new is the obligation on the _host_ side, and it is a build error rather than a
  silent one. Before this, a host reached these packages with a glob over the monorepo
  (`@source "../../packages/**"`), which named a directory no installed tree has —
  and Tailwind reports nothing at all about a source that matches nothing, so such a host
  built green and rendered every screen unstyled. A host that now names a package that is
  not installed gets `Can't resolve`, and one whose tarball omits the file gets
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.

  `@endora-commerce/cms-components` deliberately does **not** publish this subpath. It
  ships a finished, prefixed stylesheet at `./styles.css` and must not also be scanned by
  its host.

## 0.7.0

### Major Changes

- bd79430: **Breaking:** `@endora-commerce/mod-blog/backend` no longer exports any entity class by name.
  It exports one `entities` array instead (D-168).

  ```ts
  // before — eleven names, one per class
  import { BlogPost, BlogCategory } from '@endora-commerce/mod-blog/backend';

  // after — there is no replacement, and that is the point
  import { entities } from '@endora-commerce/mod-blog/backend';
  // entities: readonly [BlogCategory, BlogCategoryLanguage, BlogCategorySalesChannel,
  //   BlogPost, BlogPostCategory, BlogPostLanguage, BlogPostRelatedPost,
  //   BlogPostRelatedProduct, BlogPostSalesChannel, BlogPostTag, BlogTag]
  ```

  The array is the value a host's ORM registers, and it is what this package's consumers actually
  need: `configured-entities.ts` merges it into the entity set, and nothing else can usefully
  name an entity class. If you were importing one as a **type**, you were reaching into another
  module's internals — reach for the shape in `@endora-commerce/contracts` instead
  (`BlogPostDetail`, `BlogPostSummary`, `BlogCategoryTreeNode`, …), which is the published
  contract for every one of these rows. If you were relating to one with a MikroORM decorator,
  that was already forbidden (`check:kernel-boundary`, D-32).

  **Also fixed, and it was worse:** `@endora-commerce/mod-blog/migrations` now exports a
  `migrations` array beside the migration class it already named. It published only
  `export * from './20260506T081055_blog_init.js'`, and the platform's package loader refuses a
  `./migrations` export that declares no such array — so **an installed copy of this package
  stopped the host from booting**, with
  `the "./migrations" export of @endora-commerce/mod-blog exports no 'migrations' array`. The
  class name is unchanged, so no database sees a migration it has already applied as pending.

  Neither defect was reachable from this repository, which is why both shipped: a workspace
  member is linked rather than installed, and the host's committed entity registry imported the
  eleven classes directly. Packed into a tarball and installed into an instance — the way the
  package is actually consumed — the module registered **zero** entities, silently, once the
  migrations barrel stopped refusing the package outright.

### Minor Changes

- 59c59c6: `cms` and `blog` ship their admin screens, and `cms` publishes its page-builder canvas.

  **Two packages' `./admin` subpath is new, and `@endora-commerce/mod-cms` gains a second UI
  subpath.** Eighteen routes and seven sidebar entries between them, at the paths the
  hand-written host registrations carried, plus `./admin-ui` on `cms` for the one component
  another module renders. The exported symbol on `./admin` is the same one every other module
  package uses — `contributions`, an `AdminContributions` object, and nothing else.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-cms` — **new `./admin` subpath**, exporting `contributions`. Eleven
    routes: `/cms` and `/cms/pages` (the landing route) on `cms.read`, `/cms/pages/:id`,
    `/cms/blocks`, `/cms/blocks/:id`, `/cms/templates`, `/cms/templates/:id` and `/cms/hooks`
    on `cms.read`, and `/cms/pages/new`, `/cms/blocks/new` and `/cms/templates/new` on
    **`cms.write`**. `/cms` is a second declaration of the page list rather than a redirect,
    because a redirect would be the consuming application's route and not this module's. Four
    sidebar rows, in the `content` section at weights 100 to 400.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-blog` — **new `./admin` subpath**, exporting `contributions`. Seven
    routes: `/blog/posts` (the landing route), `/blog/posts/:id`, `/blog/categories`,
    `/blog/categories/:id` and `/blog/tags` on `blog.read`, and `/blog/posts/new` and
    `/blog/categories/new` on **`blog.write`**. Three sidebar rows, in the `content` section at
    weights 600 to 800.

  **The five create routes take the write code, and that is a behaviour change for a consumer
  rendering these routes.** Each create screen exists to write — `POST /api/v1/admin/cms/pages`
  and its four siblings enforce the write code — and each module's own palette action
  (`new-page`, `new-post`) already advertised that code. The routes were ungated while they
  belonged to the admin application, so a read-only operator could open a form whose save then
  refused. The five create controls are gated on the same code in this release — the _New page_,
  _New block_, _New template_, _New post_ and _New category_ buttons and the category tree's
  _+ Child_ — so the dead end is closed at both ends. `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels`
  ships the identical split for `/sales-channels/new` and `@endora-commerce/mod-credentials` for
  `/credentials/new`.

  **`CategoryTreeNode` takes a new required prop.** It is not exported from any subpath, so this
  affects nobody outside the package; it is recorded because the prop is `canCreate: boolean`
  and required rather than optional — a caller that forgets it does not compile, which is the
  direction a permission gate has to fail in.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-cms` — new `./admin-ui` subpath, exporting `PageBuilderEditor` and the
  `PageBuilderData` type.** This is the Puck canvas the CMS page, block and template editors
  render and that `@endora-commerce/mod-blog`'s post and category editors render too. Its props
  are `data` in and `onChange` back, so the consumer decides that it appears — a published
  component rather than something the owner contributes to a place of its own choosing. It is
  not in `@endora-commerce/admin-kit` because it is a `@measured/puck` host and the kit is what
  every module's admin layer compiles against, and not in
  `@endora-commerce/page-builder-admin` because it calls this module's API client, reads this
  module's translation namespace and lays the CMS page container out — that package holds the
  builder chrome that names no module at all.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-blog` gains `@endora-commerce/mod-cms` as a peer dependency**, which
  is what a published component costs: the reach survives into the emitted JavaScript, so a
  consumer bundling `blog`'s admin layer must resolve `cms`. It is not a `dependency` — a module
  reaches another through a port declared in its manifest, never through npm — and it is not
  optional. A consumer that installs `@endora-commerce/mod-blog` without `@endora-commerce/mod-cms`
  will fail to resolve `@endora-commerce/mod-cms/admin-ui` at bundle time. There is no runtime
  half to worry about: `blog`'s module manifest already declares `cms` in its `dependencies`, so
  a platform where `cms` is absent or switched off is one where `blog` cannot be activated
  either.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-cms` and `@endora-commerce/mod-blog` ship new i18n keys, and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n` loses seven.** `nav.cmsPages.label`, `nav.cmsBlocks.label`,
  `nav.cmsTemplates.label`, `nav.cmsHooks.label`, `nav.blogPosts.label`,
  `nav.blogCategories.label` and `nav.blogTags.label` are in the two modules' own
  `i18n/{en,pl}.json`; `appShell.nav.cmsPages`, `appShell.nav.cmsBlocks`,
  `appShell.nav.cmsTemplates`, `appShell.nav.cmsHooks`, `appShell.nav.blogPosts`,
  `appShell.nav.blogCategories` and `appShell.nav.blogTags` are removed from the shared bundle
  in both shipped languages, nothing rendering them any more. **A consumer resolving one of
  those seven keys out of the `core` namespace will get a raw key**; each has a
  module-namespaced replacement above.

  **Neither module declares a new palette action, and neither loses one.** `cms` has declared
  `new-page` and `blog` `new-post` all along, and the admin application's own palette table
  never carried a hand-written row for either — so unlike batches 10, 13 and 14 there was
  nothing to convert.

- f66359f: The stored Page Builder block names are namespaced, once, by five migrations.

  Each of the five table-owning modules rewrites **its own** columns — `cms` three, `blog`
  two, `transactional_emails` three, `newsletter` two, `invoices` one — with a recursive
  `pg_temp` function generated from `FROZEN_BLOCK_RENAMES`. A migration belongs to the module
  that owns the **table**, never to the module that owns the new name, so no new manifest
  `dependencies` edge arises: a block name is a string value inside a JSONB document, not a
  foreign key.

  The rewrite is **structural**: it replaces the value of a `type` property in a node position
  and nothing else. Twelve of the 74 names are ordinary English words (`Row`, `Text`, `Image`,
  `Map`, `Button`, …) that occur throughout shop content, so a textual substitution would
  corrupt a `RawHtml` block's markup and every `alt` attribute in the shop.

  It is **idempotent by construction** — every key of the map is bare and every value is
  dotted, so a second run finds nothing — and it **cannot fail on its input**: a name the map
  does not hold is left byte-identical and reported, never quarantined. `down()` applies the
  inverse over the identical walk.

  `cms` gains an operator command for the pre-flight:

  ```
  pnpm --filter backend run cli -- cms block-names
  ```

  Read-only, across all eleven columns, classifying every stored name as _will be renamed →
  new name_, _already namespaced_ or _unrecognised_. Run it before upgrading, resolve or accept
  the unrecognised set, take a backup, upgrade, and run it again: every _will be renamed_
  becomes _already namespaced_ and the unrecognised set is unchanged.

  `catalog`, `orders` and `ksef` are patch-bumped because their block declarations are now what
  the registry serves — the eight `catalog` blocks, the eight `orders` ones and
  `ksef.InvoiceSection` were previously registered as `cms`' and `invoices`'.

- 6a9ae1d: New package: the Blog module, the first to leave `backend/src/modules/` (feature 080, T040b).

  It publishes three subpaths and no root wildcard, and every one of them serves compiled
  output (D-164):
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-blog` — the manifest. Isomorphic, `@endora-commerce/contracts` its
    only import, and the file the generated manifest index reads the module's identity,
    permissions, palette actions and activation control from.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-blog/backend` — `registerModule(ctx)` plus the `entities` array the
    host's ORM registry spreads (see `blog-entities-array-d168.md`; this file described the
    eleven `@Entity()` classes as named exports, which they no longer are).
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-blog/migrations` — the `migrations` array the platform's package loader
    reads, and `Migration20260506T081055BlogInit` by name for the host's migration registry.

  `@endora-commerce/platform` is a `peerDependency` (D-160.2), and so are `@mikro-orm/*`,
  `fastify`, `ioredis` and `zod`. The package holds one copy of nothing: it resolves the host
  through the same `exports` map the application does, which is what keeps `HttpError`,
  `SalesChannel` and `effectiveState` single in the process.

  The manifest id stays `blog` — it is identity of record for the lifecycle registry, the
  settings store, the permission codes, the i18n bundle paths and the migration ownership
  (D-142). The npm name is only how npm keeps names unique.

### Patch Changes

- 54587bf: `blog` declares the nineteen error codes it owns.

  `manifest.ts` gains an `errorCodes` array — feature 090 Phase 3
  (`specs/090-module-owned-error-codes/`). Nothing the package exports changes
  shape. The observable difference for a consumer is that this module's error
  sentences are now routed by its own declaration rather than only by the prefix
  chain in `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`, which continues to answer identically for
  every one of them: the list is the chain's own answer, copied verbatim from the
  frozen capture, and is asserted equal to it in both directions.

  All nineteen already carry a written sentence in both `en` and `pl` in this
  package's own `i18n/` bundles, so no sentence moves and none is added. No
  `tokens`: no code this module raises passes a `details.code` discriminator.

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.
