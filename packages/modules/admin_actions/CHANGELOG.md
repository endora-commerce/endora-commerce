# @endora-commerce/mod-admin-actions

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- efa4111: Six more modules become workspace packages (feature 080, T040b batch five):
  `admin_actions`, `admin_roles`, `admin_users`, `megamenu`, `organizations` and
  `price_lists`. Each ships `dist` and resolves through its own `exports` map — the
  root for its manifest, `./backend` for `registerModule` plus the `entities`
  array, `./migrations` for its migration classes where it owns any — exactly as
  the fifty-three packages before them.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-organizations` publishes a `./ports` subpath.** It is
  type-only: `tsc` emits `export {};`, and it is where a consumer names
  `PersonalOrganizationProvisionApi` and `PersonalOrganizationProvisionInput`
  instead of reaching into the owner's directory.

  ```ts
  import type { PersonalOrganizationProvisionApi } from '@endora-commerce/mod-organizations/ports';
  ```

  The implementation stays behind the container name
  `personalOrganizationProvisionPort`, resolved with `lazyPort`, so the gate that
  answers 503 `MODULE_DISABLED` when `organizations` is switched off is still the
  registration and not a call anyone has to remember to write.

  **Three packages publish a runtime binding by name, beside the `entities`
  array.** D-168 keeps entity classes off `./backend`; these are not entities, and
  each is exported because a host program must hold the _same_ copy the platform
  composed rather than a second one evaluated from source (D-160.6.1):
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-admin-roles/backend` — `PermissionCatalogueService`,
    `listAssignablePermissionCodes`, and the inventory scanner
    (`ConstantResolver`, `defaultScanRoots`, `scanEnforcedPermissionCodes`,
    `scanEnforcedPermissionGates`). The acceptance instance probe and
    `check:action-route-permissions` read them.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-price-lists/backend` — `DefaultPriceListMigrator`,
    `DEFAULT_PRICE_LIST_ID` and `PriceListService`. The development catalog seed
    runs the migrator; a second copy would `em.create` a `PriceList` class the ORM
    never registered, which fails at the first insert rather than at load.

  **Nothing about a module's behaviour changed.** No manifest `dependencies` array
  moved, so the migration order is the same function of the same inputs: the
  committed registry's `(moduleId, className)` declaration sequence and its
  computed execution sequence are byte-identical to the merge base over all 164
  entries.

### Patch Changes

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.
