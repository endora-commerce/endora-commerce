## 0.11.1

### Patch Changes

- cbe6b7f: Two `EntityManager`-taking seams for renaming an attribute key after create, both additive and both run on the caller's transaction so a definition key and the values stored under it move together.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-custom-fields/ports`: `CustomFieldDefinitionApplyApi.applyRenameKey(em, id, expectedKey, newKey)`, served by the existing `customFieldDefinitionService` registration. It is not an edit — `UpdateCustomFieldDefinitionRequest` still omits `key` — and it refuses a definition whose key is no longer `expectedKey` (`key_changed`), a key another definition of the same entity type holds (`duplicate_key`) and a key outside the grammar (`invalid_key`). It flushes before it returns, dispatches no command and publishes no invalidation: call `publishInvalidate` after your transaction commits. A test double implementing `CustomFieldDefinitionApplyApi` needs the new method.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-catalog/ports` (new, type-only subpath): `CatalogAttributeValueKeyApi.renameValueKey(em, fromKey, toKey, { occupied })`, registered as `catalogAttributeValueKeyPort`. It moves the key in `products.attribute_values` and `product_value_overrides.attribute_key` and answers how many rows of each moved. `occupied` is required and decides what happens to data already stored under `toKey`, which it reads and locks first: `'refuse'` throws `target_occupied` with both counts before anything is written; `'displace'` removes those values and override rows — on every product holding them — and returns them in `displaced.values` / `displaced.overrides` before the key moves, so nothing is merged over and no unique index is hit. `name`, `description` and keys outside the attribute grammar are refused before any statement runs.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- e915c1e: `catalog` now creates the nine stock-management columns its entities map, in `Migration20260925T125527CatalogInventoryColumns`: `products.{manage_stock, backorder_enabled, low_stock_threshold, low_stock_threshold_mode, fulfilment_strategy, fulfilment_strategy_warehouse_order}` and `categories.inventory_threshold_{high,medium,low}`, together with `products_fulfilment_strategy_check` and `products_low_stock_threshold_mode_check`.

  Until now only `@endora-commerce/mod-inventory`'s migrations created them. `inventory` is switchable and `catalog` does not depend on it, so an instance assembled without `inventory` — the default free set — could not read or insert a product or a category, and a hard uninstall of `inventory` dropped the columns. The new migration uses `add column if not exists` with the original types and defaults, and adds each constraint behind a `pg_constraint` check: on every database that already has them it is a no-op that keeps every value, and on a fresh one it creates them. Its `down()` is deliberately empty, because `products` and `categories` are the platform's tables and their rows outlive `catalog`.

  Regenerate the migration registry (`pnpm --filter backend run composer:generate` in this repository, `endora generate` in an instance) so the migration runs.

### Patch Changes

- b9c6686: These modules derive an attribute's API type from `@endora-commerce/contracts`' `apiAttributeTypeOf` instead of each carrying its own copy of the rule. `catalog`'s `dbToApiAttributeType` keeps its `numericKind`; `pim_ergonode` checks a binding candidate against the shared function (`pim_unopim` made the same move and has since left this repository; its version with the change is cut from the paid-modules repository). The internal `endoraApiAttributeTypeOf` helper is removed from `pim_unopim`, `pim_ergonode` and `pim_pimcore`; no published subpath exported it.

  Behaviour is unchanged. The modules require a `@endora-commerce/contracts` release that exports `apiAttributeTypeOf`.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-pim-pimcore` carries this change as well; it has left for the paid-modules repository, and its next version is cut there.

- 32fdf20: The `LICENSE` file in each package now names the copyright holder as Endora sp. z o.o.

  The MIT licence text is unchanged; only its copyright line moves from `Copyright (c) 2026 Endora`
  to `Copyright (c) 2026 Endora sp. z o.o.`, the registered legal entity. Nothing a package exports,
  declares or depends on changes. `@endora-commerce/contracts` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-invoice-ledger` also carry a one-sentence rewording in an already-published
  `CHANGELOG.md` entry, with no change to what that entry says about the code.

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- 4915024: Comarch ERP XL integration (feature 119): shared ERP connector layer and Comarch XL adapter.

  **`@endora-commerce/contracts`** adds `erp-connector.ts` and `comarch-xl.ts` (admin and wire
  schemas), `erpConnector` on `ModuleManifestSchema`, and `COMARCH_XL_*` / `ERP_CONNECTOR_*`
  error codes.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-erp-connector`** is a new non-deactivatable infra package: mutual
  exclusion registry (`erpConnectorRegistryPort`), activation lock entity, and shared job/run
  vocabulary. Subpaths: `.`, `./backend`, `./migrations`.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-comarch-xl`** is a new switchable connector package: OpenAPI v0.1.0
  REST client, identity mapping, BullMQ detect/sync pipeline, domain apply services, admin UI,
  and documented overlay ports. Subpaths: `.`, `./backend`, `./migrations`, `./admin`. Ships
  `i18n/` and operator documentation under `docs/`.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-invoices`** extends the module with `erpSaleDocumentWritePort`,
  ERP-imported sale document entities, B2B customer routes, and attachment handling for XL
  sale documents.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-inventory`** extends `inventoryStockImportPort` for Comarch XL stock
  apply wiring (warehouse snapshot import).

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-catalog`** honours `createProduct` request `status` instead of
  always defaulting new products to `draft`.

  Activation is gated by `comarch_xl.enabled` (default off). Only one `erpConnector: true`
  module may be operator-active at a time.

- 8f61a6b: Every published package now ships its own `LICENSE` and `README.md`.

  npm force-includes a file named `LICENSE` into the tarball exactly as it does `README.md`,
  whatever `files` says, so the text has to be in the package directory and not only at the
  repository root — `LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md` states that rule and, until this release, no package
  obeyed it. Measured on `master`: **0** of the 82 publishable packages carried a `LICENSE` and
  **14** carried a `README.md`, so every tarball shipped without licence text and 68 registry
  pages would have rendered empty.

  Both files are **generated**, by `pnpm --filter backend run manifests:generate`, and refused
  when stale by `manifests:check` in the `quality` job:
  - the `LICENSE` is the repository's root `LICENSE`, copied verbatim — the same single source
    the `license: MIT` field is already rendered from. A package that declares a licence of its
    own in the `SEE LICENSE IN <file>` form is skipped and keeps the file it names.
  - the `README.md` is rendered from what the package's own manifest declares: its description,
    its module id where it has one, every published subpath with what that layer holds, its peer
    dependencies with the optional ones marked, the locales its `i18n/` carries and what the
    tarball ships. A `README.md` **without** the generated marker on its first line is a human's
    and is never rewritten — the fourteen that existed are untouched.

  Five module packages also get their npm description back. `@endora-commerce/mod-blog`,
  `mod-credit-limits`, `mod-dhl-parcel`, `mod-google-analytics` and `mod-quote-requests` carried
  the note written when they were moved out of `backend/src/modules` — _"the first module to
  leave backend/src/modules … the manifest id stays identity of record"_ — as the sentence a
  registry shows under the package name. Each now carries the sentence its own module manifest
  declares, which is where `descriptionFor` seeds one from in the first place.

  No API changes, no new dependency, no behaviour change: what moves is what the tarball carries
  and what a package page says.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 0eeb9b5: Require Node >= 22.18.0.

  The previous floor was 22.17.0, which MikroORM 7 sets. 22.18.0 is the first release that
  strips TypeScript types without a flag, and that is what loads a deployment's overlay module:
  in a scaffolded instance `apps/` is outside every compiled member, so the unit the platform
  `import()`s is the client's own `.ts`. On 22.17.x that import throws
  `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` and the process dies before it listens. Emitting a `.js` beside
  the client's source was measured and refused — the overlay loader resolves `.js` before `.ts`
  while the divergence derivation admits both, so the sibling doubles every seam site in the
  report.

  Derived by probing 22.17.0, 22.17.1, 22.18.0 and 22.19.0 against a `.ts` module imported with
  no flag; 22.18.0 is the lowest that loads it.

  If you run 22.17.x, upgrade to 22.18 or later. Nothing else in these packages changed.

### Patch Changes

- 7698fae: The attribute page's "See also" refers to `promotions` by name instead of
  linking `../promotions.md`. `promotions` is not in the module set
  `endora new instance` writes, so the relative link named a page that is not in
  an instance's documentation tree and `onBrokenLinks: 'throw'` refused the whole
  site. The sentence now says the same thing whether or not the reader installed
  the sibling.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 02838b7: Nine modules now declare the environment inputs they own, in `manifest.env`, so a
  client who installs them can be told what to put in their `.env`. Each declaration
  carries an English and a Polish sentence, a requirement, and — for an `optional`
  one — what is lost without it.

  `health_checks` was the tenth until D-229 dissolved it into the platform; its two
  declarations went with it, and `search`'s `MEILISEARCH_URL` went with them,
  because the platform now declares that name and a module may not describe a
  platform input a second time.

  Nothing changes at runtime: no module reads a new variable and none changes how it
  reads an existing one. What changes is that the requirement is now on the wire, in
  the manifest the platform already carries, and reaches a consumer through the
  package's own `exports` map.

  Every module here declares only what it **owns**. The seven platform-owned names
  these modules read — `NODE_ENV`, `BACKEND_ROLE`, `STOREFRONT_BASE_URL`,
  `PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`, `BACKEND_PUBLIC_URL`, `REVALIDATE_SECRET` and
  `SETTINGS_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` — are declared by `@endora-commerce/platform` and
  are deliberately not repeated here.

- bd596a9: The sales-channel bridge tables are declared by the modules that own them, not by the platform.

  **`@endora-commerce/platform`** — `SalesChannelMembershipService` no longer holds a map total over
  `ChannelMemberEntityTypeSchema`. It resolves `{ table, entityIdColumn }` through a new
  `ChannelBridgeRegistry`, which each owning module fills at compose time, and a composition root
  contributes as the container name `salesChannelBridgeRegistry`. `composeSalesChannelsKernel` takes
  an optional `bridgeRegistry` and returns the one it used on `SalesChannelsKernel.bridgeRegistry`.

  For a consumer the visible change is at the call site: a membership call for an entity type **no
  installed module registered** now refuses with `503 MODULE_DISABLED`, naming the entity type in
  `error.details`, **before** it reaches the database. It previously executed SQL against the table
  the map named, which on an instance that never installed the owning module is a relation that does
  not exist — inside whatever transaction the caller had already opened. `ChannelMemberEntityType`
  is unchanged and stays the published vocabulary; the registry decides which of its members are
  live.

  `SalesChannelMembershipService`'s constructor takes the registry as an optional fourth argument,
  defaulting to the process-level one, so an existing construction site compiles and runs unchanged.

  **The module packages** — each now exports `salesChannelBridges`, the bridge or bridges it owns,
  from its `./backend` subpath, and registers them from a boot hook. `catalog` owns two (`product`
  and `category`); the other seven own one each. The registration is a contribution and carries no
  presence probe: the rows outlive an operator switching the module off, so the bridge stays
  readable, exactly as the asset-reference and language-reference registries state for their own
  contributions.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels`** — `SalesChannelsService` held a second copy of the same
  nine triples, read by the channel-delete sweep, justified by a circular import that had not existed
  since the membership service moved into the kernel. It is gone; the service takes the registry as a
  new required constructor argument, in fifth position, and the delete sweep iterates the bridges
  that are actually registered — so a channel can be deleted on an instance that never installed
  `cms`.

- 8e86e55: Eleven container names a module read and nothing defaulted are now defaulted by
  the module that reads them, so a composition that contributes nothing can
  resolve every one of them.

  `@endora-commerce/platform` — `composeApp` registers two more names:
  `customerOrganizationIdResolver`, the tenth actor-shaped name, whose value
  expression reads `request.actor` and nothing else; and `newsletterTokenSecret`,
  the resolved `NEWSLETTER_TOKEN_SECRET`.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter` — `newsletterModule`'s `defaultChannelId`
  option becomes `resolveDefaultChannelId: () => Promise<string | null>`. A
  consumer composing the module through `registerModule` is unaffected; a consumer
  calling `newsletterModule` directly passes `async () => null` where it passed
  `null`. The `NewsletterBridge` interface is removed — the module reads its nine
  members itself.

  `mod-catalog`, `mod-customers`, `mod-ksef`, `mod-orders`, `mod-quote-requests` —
  each registers the names it reads. No published shape changes; a composition
  that contributes one of them still overrides the default, which is what the
  contribution window is for.

  `mod-catalog`, `mod-customers` and `mod-orders` declare new manifest edges for
  ports they now resolve themselves: `catalog` -> `search:searchReindexPort`,
  `customers` -> `admin_roles`, `orders` -> `admin_users` and `admin_roles`. Every
  one of those owners declares `activation.nonDeactivatable`, so no operator loses
  an activation control.

- 2fe0b8d: Each sales-channel bridge table is now created by the module that owns its far side.

  Under D-226 a bridge between an always-present near side and a switchable far side belongs to the
  far side. All nine `sales_channel_*` tables move accordingly, so an instance that does not install
  `cms` no longer carries a migration corpus naming `cms_pages`.

  **Nothing is re-offered to a database you have already migrated, and no reset is required.**
  `mikro_orm_migrations` stores the migration class **name** and no checksum — measured on
  `@mikro-orm/migrations@6.6.13`: `MigrationStorage.ensureTable()` builds `id`, `name` and
  `executed_at`, `logMigration` inserts `{ name }`, and `getPendingMigrations()` is `umzug.pending()`
  over those names. No class is renamed and no stamp moves, so the two edited bodies are not pending
  anywhere.

  **`@endora-commerce/platform`** — two frozen migrations lose statements and keep their class names.
  `Migration20260430T170044CoreSalesChannelsPromote` loses eight `create table "sales_channel_*"`
  statements with their indexes from `up()` and the matching eight `drop table` from `down()`;
  `Migration20260424T165847CoreFoundationInit` loses `create table "sales_channel_products"`, its
  index and its `drop table`. Everything those migrations do to a kernel table is untouched — the
  channel identity columns, the backfills, the one-system-default partial unique index and the
  `quote_requests.sales_channel_id` column all stay exactly where they were. `BASELINE_MIGRATIONS` is
  byte-identical, so no position in the frozen prefix moves.

  **Each far-side module** gains one migration (`@endora-commerce/mod-catalog` gains two, for
  `sales_channel_products` and `sales_channel_categories`). Each is a `create table if not exists`
  carrying the frozen statement's own column list, primary key, both foreign keys and index, plus a
  `create index if not exists`, and each drops its own table in `down()`. On a database that has
  applied the frozen migrations every one of them is a no-op: measured on a throwaway database
  migrated at the previous release and then upgraded, all nine relations keep their `pg_class` OID,
  so no table is recreated and no row is touched. On a fresh database they are the creation, later in
  the computed order than before — which is where they have to be for an instance that omits one of
  these modules to migrate at all.

  **One behaviour changes on purpose.** A hard uninstall reverts by registry `moduleId`, so
  `module:uninstall --hard cms` now drops `sales_channel_cms_pages` along with the rest of that
  module's schema. That is the ownership rule doing what it says, and it is what an operator would
  expect of a table whose far side has just been removed.

  The published `ChannelMemberEntityTypeSchema` vocabulary is unchanged, and no wire shape moves.

### Patch Changes

- f20bc38: Documentation: these packages' pages no longer link Endora's own documentation
  site by relative path.

  A page each package ships under `docs/` linked `../architecture/…` or
  `../integrations/…` — a page above the modules category, which is site content
  and travels with no package. Installed anywhere but the Endora repository, the
  link named a page that is not there, and a documentation build over the
  installed set therefore failed under Docusaurus's `onBrokenLinks: 'throw'` —
  whatever else was installed alongside. The guides are now named in prose.

  No exported symbol, schema, route or translation key changes.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 83ffe79: The product create form is a declared admin route on `catalog:write`, and the two
  _New product_ affordances on the product list are gated on the same code (D-221).

  `contributions.routes` gains `/catalog/products/new` before the existing
  `/catalog/products/:id`, which keeps `catalog:read`. Both entries resolve the same
  `ProductEditor` component — the id `new` is what its own `params.id === 'new'` reads — so
  this splits one screen's two entry points rather than adding a screen.

  **What changes for an operator.** A role holding `catalog:read` and not `catalog:write`
  can no longer open the product create form, and no longer sees a button offering it. That
  role could not create a product before either: the save refused. What it had was a form it
  could fill in and not submit, and since feature 091 the admin router enforces a route's
  declared code, so once this route exists an ungated button would send that role to the
  admin's not-found page — which says nothing about permissions. The affordance therefore
  moves with the route.

  **The manifest declares `{ code: 'catalog:write', requires: ['catalog:read'] }`.**
  `ProductEditor`'s loader fetches `/api/v1/admin/catalog/categories` and
  `/api/v1/admin/catalog/attribute-sets` unconditionally — before any `isNew` branch, with
  the create path using the second to select the new product's default attribute set — and
  both are `requireAdmin('catalog:read')`. So the write code alone opens the route and
  cannot render the form. `requires` is advisory (D-175): nothing is refused at the gate, and
  the role editor renders the shortfall with a one-click add. The requirement is attached to
  the code rather than to the screen, so every holder of `catalog:write` is advised to add
  `catalog:read`, including holders of gates other modules enforce with it.

  **If you consume this package's `./admin` contributions**, the `routes` array is one entry
  longer and its order changed; nothing was removed and no `requiredPermission` on an
  existing entry moved. `i18n/{en,pl}.json` gain `productsList.empty.readOnly`, the
  empty-state sentence a role without the write code sees in place of the one that carried
  the create link.

- 034f190: The module declares its demo data: `manifest.demo` creates the demo's three-level category tree,
  200 generated products, three composites and the composites' own structure, and withdraws them
  again.

  `endora demo seed` now reports `catalog` by name with what it created, and `endora demo reset`
  removes it. Both bodies are reached by a relative `await import()` from the manifest, so nothing
  is loaded by the processes that merely compose the platform, and the module gained no `exports`
  subpath, no `files` entry and no manifest `dependencies` entry.

  **The catalogue is generated, not shipped.** The products, their descriptions and their images
  are built in process, so this package ships no non-`.ts` demo asset at all: 200 products cost
  the same bytes as 10 000.

  **Three things the block used to hold are not this module's demo data.** A product attribute is a
  `custom_fields` definition paired to one of this module's extension rows; a placeholder image and
  a sample attachment each mint an `assets_library` asset and hand its id to one of this module's
  tables. Each writes two modules' rows in one statement, so each belongs to whoever owns the
  instance. A consumer that seeds through this body alone gets a catalogue with no attributes, no
  images and no attachments — a coherent shop, and a plainer one.

  **The withdrawal changed, and it is the largest repair in the series.** The host's demo reset
  cleared `products`, `categories`, the composites' three structure tables and eleven more with a
  `truncate … cascade`. It now deletes only the slugs and the slug prefix `seed` assigns, deepest
  first, so a catalogue an operator has been building survives a demo reset — as do their uploaded
  assets and their own product-host attributes, which the same cascade had been taking.

  Seeding twice creates nothing the second time and reports the same counts.

- e27bf6c: Every package that ships scannable UI now publishes its own Tailwind `@source`
  declarations at a new `./tailwind.css` subpath.

  A host compiling this package's utility classes no longer has to know where the
  package's sources are. Import the subpath from the stylesheet that builds your
  admin, and the package names its own layers:

  ```css
  @import 'tailwindcss';
  @import '@endora-commerce/mod-blog/tailwind.css';
  ```

  `@source` resolves relative to the stylesheet that declares it, so the paths hold
  wherever the package is installed. The file is generated from the package's layer
  inventory, ships in the tarball beside `package.json`, and its `dist` line is the one
  that matters to you — the `src` line beside it is inert in a published package and
  exists so that a checkout of this repository keeps scanning source in `dev`.

  **Nothing is removed or renamed**: every existing subpath resolves exactly as before.
  What is new is the obligation on the _host_ side, and it is a build error rather than a
  silent one. Before this, a host reached these packages with a glob over the monorepo
  (`@source "../../packages/**"`), which named a directory no installed tree has —
  and Tailwind reports nothing at all about a source that matches nothing, so such a host
  built green and rendered every screen unstyled. A host that now names a package that is
  not installed gets `Can't resolve`, and one whose tarball omits the file gets
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.

  `@endora-commerce/cms-components` deliberately does **not** publish this subpath. It
  ships a finished, prefixed stylesheet at `./styles.css` and must not also be scanned by
  its host.

- 0ab2044: Publish the object store, the availability port and the batched category and
  asset reads `product_feeds` reached through a composition root.

  `@endora-commerce/contracts` gains four exports and one method, all additive:
  - `ObjectStoragePort` (container name `objectStoragePort`, owner
    `assets_library`) with `ObjectStore`, `ObjectStoragePutInput`,
    `ObjectStorageBackendCode` and `AssetByteStream`. A byte store for a module
    that keeps its own objects under its own locator prefix and creates no `Asset`
    row. `getForBackend` is **total** — `legacy` is a URL resolver for pre-013
    rows, not a store, so it is not in the code union and a consumer has no arm to
    probe for.
  - `InventoryAvailabilityPort`, the shape `inventoryAvailabilityPort` has always
    answered. The registration carried no type argument, so there was no name to
    import.
  - `CatalogCategoryReadPort.expandCategoryProductIds(categoryIds)` — the batched,
    live-narrowed, cycle-tolerant subtree walk. It is **not** a batched
    `listProductIdsInSubtree`: that one is structural by contract and is a
    recursive CTE with no cycle guard.
  - `AssetReadPort.resolvePublicUrls(assetIds)` — the stable public URL of each
    live, public asset, and nothing for the rest. Absence is the answer rather
    than an exception, because only the owner can tell a stable URL from an
    expiring signed one.

  Breaking, `@endora-commerce/mod-product-feeds`:
  - `ProductFeedsBridge` is **removed**. The module resolves the four ports above
    itself; a composition contributes nothing to it beyond deployment values.
  - `ProductFeedsModuleOptions.storageAdapters: ArtefactStorageAdapterProvider`
    becomes `objectStorage: ObjectStoragePort`. Pass the container's
    `objectStoragePort` instead of an adapter registry.
  - `ArtefactStorageAdapter` and `ArtefactStorageAdapterProvider` are removed from
    `services/artefact-store.js`; `ArtefactStorageBackend` is now
    `ObjectStorageBackendCode` and `ArtefactStorePort.open` returns a
    `node:stream` `Readable` rather than a `NodeJS.ReadableStream`.

  Breaking, `@endora-commerce/mod-catalog`:
  - `CatalogQueryService.expandCategoryProductIds` is **removed**. The same walk,
    unchanged, is `CatalogCategoryReadService.expandCategoryProductIds`, published
    on `catalogCategoryReadPort`. It is a category read and it now has one home.

### Minor Changes

- 543151a: `catalog` and `orders` ship their admin screens, and one icon name joins the allowlist.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-catalog` gains an `./admin` subpath and `@endora-commerce/mod-orders`
  gains routes and nav on the one it had.** `catalog`'s new entry point exports `contributions`
  with eight `routes` and six `nav` declarations — the product roster and editor, the category
  tree, the attribute and attribute-set registries, the attachment types and the two
  bulk-operation screens. `orders`' entry point exported `contributions` with a `zones` array and
  nothing else since P4d; it now declares four routes and three nav entries beside it. A consumer
  that composes either package's `./admin` gets those screens without editing an application file.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-catalog` declares three new manifest actions**: `open-products`,
  `open-categories` and `open-attributes`, each with the destination, permission code and keywords
  the admin's hand-written palette row carried, and with the labels and descriptions those rows
  rendered. `@endora-commerce/mod-orders`' manifest is unchanged — its palette row duplicated the
  `open-orders` action it had declared all along.

  **`@endora-commerce/contracts` adds `'ClipboardCheck'` to `KnownIconNameSchema`** and
  `@endora-commerce/admin-kit` adds the matching entry to `resolveIcon`'s map. A module
  declaration names its icon rather than importing it, and `orders`' three sidebar rows render
  that glyph.

  **Breaking for a consumer that imports these two modules' screens from the admin application.**
  Twenty-seven files moved out of `admin/src/modules/{catalog,orders}/` and four re-export shims
  were deleted with them:
  - `admin/src/modules/catalog/components/ProductPicker` — import `ProductPicker` from
    `@endora-commerce/admin-kit/components`.
  - `admin/src/modules/orders/Section` — import `Section` from `@endora-commerce/admin-kit/ui`.
  - `admin/src/modules/orders/StatusTransitionGraph` — import `StatusTransitionGraph` from
    `@endora-commerce/admin-kit/components`.
  - `admin/src/modules/orders/orderStatusColor` — `ORDER_STATUS_COLOR_PRESETS` and
    `ORDER_STATUS_DEFAULT_COLOR` are `@endora-commerce/contracts`'; `readableTextColor` and
    `statusBadgeStyle` (which that file also re-exported as `orderStatusBadgeStyle`) are
    `@endora-commerce/admin-kit/lib`'s.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-i18n` drops fifteen keys** — nine `appShell.nav.*`, four
  `appShell.palette.sub.*`, `appShell.nav.quickOrder` and `appShell.crumb.detail` — from the
  shared bundle in both shipped languages, nothing rendering them any more. Their replacements are
  module-relative keys in `@endora-commerce/mod-catalog`'s and `@endora-commerce/mod-orders`' own
  bundles.

  **One route tightens.** `/orders/new` was declared by the admin application and therefore
  ungated, while the sidebar row that advertised it carried `orders:write`; the route is
  `@endora-commerce/mod-orders`' own now and takes that code. A read-only operator who could
  previously open an order-entry form whose save would refuse now meets the admin's not-found
  treatment instead.

- 3583e78: `catalog` is a package: `@endora-commerce/mod-catalog`, with three subpaths (`.` for the
  manifest, `./backend` for composition, `./migrations` for the twenty-one migration classes) and
  an `i18n/` bundle directory beside `dist`. It is the largest module in the tree — 18 entities,
  35 services and four route surfaces — and nothing about its behaviour, schema or HTTP surface
  changes with the move.

  **`./backend` exports an `entities` array and no entity class by name** (D-168). Eighteen
  classes are reachable only through that array, which is the value the host's ORM registers, so
  there is exactly one of each in a process. That number is why the array's shape matters more
  here than anywhere else: a consumer that picks a class out of it with a `find` gets the union of
  eighteen constructors, which TypeScript collapses to one member that is almost certainly not the
  one asked for. Take the class by **name**, never by index. If you want a row's _shape_, the
  contract is in `@endora-commerce/contracts`.

  **Three names leave `./backend` on purpose**, all of them for host programs that construct
  catalogue state rather than serve it:

  ```ts
  import {
    CatalogProductReadService, // the read surface price-list migration is driven from
    legacyToCfType, // legacy attribute value type -> unified custom-field triple
    type CatalogQueryService, // the cradle slot a composition root declares
  } from '@endora-commerce/mod-catalog/backend';
  ```

  `CatalogProductReadService` and `legacyToCfType` are a service and a pure function, so D-168 —
  which bars _entity_ classes from this door — does not reach them; `CatalogQueryService` is a
  type and evaluates nothing. A host program cannot name this package's source instead: a
  compiled build sets `rootDir`, and a `.ts` outside it is a compile error even under
  `import type`.

  **Two `fastify` request properties this module reads are not its own.** `request.actor` and
  `request.apiKeyBinding` are `declare module 'fastify'` augmentations owned by `auth` and
  `api_keys`. Inside one program they are ambient; a package is its own program, so the two reads
  narrow locally rather than importing an interface neither owner publishes. An overlay wrapping
  `routes.external.ts` should expect the same.

  The twenty-one migration classes keep their names, so a database that has applied them sees
  nothing pending.

- 7af67c0: Declared as `peerDependencies` the packages these seven already publish types from (D-181).

  Each of them emits a `.d.ts` that imports a specifier its manifest declared only as a
  `devDependency`, which a consumer's install does not resolve. The consequence is silent:
  the type becomes `any`, and under `skipLibCheck: true` — what `tsc --init` writes — there
  is **no diagnostic at all**. Measured on `@endora-commerce/mod-catalog` with
  `@endora-commerce/mod-custom-fields` not installed: the exported
  `CatalogCradle.customFieldDefinitionService` typed as `any`, clean compile; with it
  installed, the correct `CustomFieldDefinitionApplyApi` and a refused assignment.

  Eleven peers, in two shapes:
  - **A published port interface of another module package** — `mod-catalog` →
    `mod-custom-fields`, `mod-customer-accounts` → `mod-organizations`, `mod-orders` →
    `mod-carts` / `mod-credit-limits` / `mod-inventory` / `mod-invoices` / `mod-promotions`,
    `mod-payments` → `mod-orders`. All are `import type … from '<pkg>/ports'` and all appear
    in the emitted declarations, so a consumer type-checking the package resolves them.
  - **A `@types/*` companion whose library reaches the declarations** — `@types/pdfmake`
    for `mod-invoices` and `mod-comparisons` (`pdfmake/interfaces.js` has no types without
    it), `@types/ssh2-sftp-client` for `mod-product-feeds`.

  **If you install one of these packages**, its peers are now install-time requirements
  rather than something your own tree happened to provide. `@types/nodemailer` and
  `@types/web-push` are deliberately _not_ among them: their libraries are imported inside
  function bodies and reach no published signature. Neither is `@types/react` or any other
  types package that contributes global declarations — those exist once in a program by
  construction, and forcing our copy is a conflict you could not fix.

  `minor` rather than `major`: nothing here changes an exported symbol or a call, and the
  requirement is one a consumer that type-checks these packages already had to satisfy for
  the types to mean anything. It is more than a patch because a resolver that was silently
  succeeding will now report an unmet peer.

- afedd32: Six modules declare the Page Builder blocks they own — all 74 of them.

  Each package's exported `manifest` gains `blocks` and `blockCategories`, and each
  ships the `blocks.<local>.label`, `blocks.<local>.description` and
  `blocks.category.<key>` entries for them in `i18n/en.json` and `i18n/pl.json`:

  | Package                    | Blocks              | Category declarations  |
  | -------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
  | `mod-cms`                  | 30                  | 8 CMS sections         |
  | `mod-catalog`              | 8 (5 CMS, 3 e-mail) | 2                      |
  | `mod-orders`               | 8 e-mail            | 1 (`order`)            |
  | `mod-transactional-emails` | 17 e-mail           | 4                      |
  | `mod-invoices`             | 10 invoice          | 1 (`invoice`)          |
  | `mod-ksef`                 | 1 invoice           | 1 (`invoice`, joining) |

  **Nothing reads these declarations yet.** The Page Builder registry is still
  populated from the single hand-written `register('cms', …)` call, the three Puck
  configs are still keyed by the bare names, and no stored document changes. Read
  the block `name`s as the names those blocks will have, not as names anything
  resolves today.

  Two `(key, context)` sections are declared by two modules each and **merge**:
  the e-mail `content` section (`mod-transactional-emails` names it,
  `mod-catalog` joins) and the `invoice` section (`mod-invoices` names it,
  `mod-ksef` joins). A joining declaration carries its own `titleKey` and omits
  `weight` and `visible`, so it cannot take a presentation its author did not
  intend to take while still being able to title the section on its own when the
  namer is switched off.

  Three sections change owner or gain a member, which is the point of the exercise
  rather than a side effect: the CMS `catalog` section is `mod-catalog`'s (`cms`
  hand-writes it and owns no block in it); the e-mail `order` section is
  `mod-orders`'; `cms.InsertTemplate` and `transactional_emails.EmailInsertTemplate`
  gain a section, having had none; and `transactional_emails.EmailColumn` moves into
  a new hidden `internal` section.

  `mod-cms`' bundles rename one key: `pageBuilder.categories._internal` becomes
  `pageBuilder.categories.internal`, following the category key in
  `@endora-commerce/cms-components`. The rendered title is unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- f66359f: The stored Page Builder block names are namespaced, once, by five migrations.

  Each of the five table-owning modules rewrites **its own** columns — `cms` three, `blog`
  two, `transactional_emails` three, `newsletter` two, `invoices` one — with a recursive
  `pg_temp` function generated from `FROZEN_BLOCK_RENAMES`. A migration belongs to the module
  that owns the **table**, never to the module that owns the new name, so no new manifest
  `dependencies` edge arises: a block name is a string value inside a JSONB document, not a
  foreign key.

  The rewrite is **structural**: it replaces the value of a `type` property in a node position
  and nothing else. Twelve of the 74 names are ordinary English words (`Row`, `Text`, `Image`,
  `Map`, `Button`, …) that occur throughout shop content, so a textual substitution would
  corrupt a `RawHtml` block's markup and every `alt` attribute in the shop.

  It is **idempotent by construction** — every key of the map is bare and every value is
  dotted, so a second run finds nothing — and it **cannot fail on its input**: a name the map
  does not hold is left byte-identical and reported, never quarantined. `down()` applies the
  inverse over the identical walk.

  `cms` gains an operator command for the pre-flight:

  ```
  pnpm --filter backend run cli -- cms block-names
  ```

  Read-only, across all eleven columns, classifying every stored name as _will be renamed →
  new name_, _already namespaced_ or _unrecognised_. Run it before upgrading, resolve or accept
  the unrecognised set, take a backup, upgrade, and run it again: every _will be renamed_
  becomes _already namespaced_ and the unrecognised set is unchanged.

  `catalog`, `orders` and `ksef` are patch-bumped because their block declarations are now what
  the registry serves — the eight `catalog` blocks, the eight `orders` ones and
  `ksef.InvoiceSection` were previously registered as `cms`' and `invoices`'.

- e969343: `catalog` declares the forty-seven error codes it owns.

  `manifest.ts` gains an `errorCodes` array — feature 090 Phase 3
  (`specs/090-module-owned-error-codes/`). Nothing the package exports changes
  shape. The observable difference for a consumer is that this module's error
  sentences are now routed by its own declaration rather than only by the prefix
  chain in `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`, which continues to answer identically for
  every one of them: the list is the chain's own answer, copied from the frozen
  capture, and is asserted equal to it in both directions.

- 5d9bb88: Error-code ownership: Tier B's six already-bundled modules declare the codes they own, and eight
  placeholder sentences leave the platform bundle.

  `manifest.errorCodes` gains seven codes on `@endora-commerce/mod-customer-accounts`
  (`ACCOUNT_BLOCKED`, `CANNOT_DEMOTE_LAST_ADMIN`, `CANNOT_REMOVE_LAST_ADMIN` and the four
  `CUSTOMER_*` record codes), six on `@endora-commerce/mod-catalog` (`BULK_TOO_LARGE`, the three
  `PACKAGING_UNIT_*` codes, `SELECTION_TOO_LARGE`, `SYSTEM_ATTRIBUTE_SET_IMMUTABLE`), three on
  `@endora-commerce/mod-orders` (`CURRENCY_MISMATCH`, `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REQUIRED`,
  `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED`), two on `@endora-commerce/mod-mfa` (`TWO_FACTOR_REQUIRED`,
  `TWO_FACTOR_REQUIRED_BY_ROLE`), one on `@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter`
  (`ALREADY_SUBSCRIBED`) and one on `@endora-commerce/mod-promotions` (`PROMOTION_INVALID`);
  `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n` drops the same twenty from its own declaration, which is what
  decides where the error envelope looks for a sentence (D-129's remaining sweep, MR 4 of eight;
  D-121 tiers T1 and T2; D-186 §1 and §2 in `specs/080-f4-real-scope/rulings.md`;
  `specs/090-module-owned-error-codes/d129-sweep.md`).

  `@endora-commerce/mod-customer-accounts`, `@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-promotions` declare an error code for the first time. No wire shape moves:
  `error.code` is unchanged for all twenty.

  **Eight sentences are deleted from `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`'s bundle, and this is
  operator-visible.** Each was the error code rewritten twice — `"Currency Mismatch."` in `en` and
  `"Błąd: currency mismatch."` in `pl` — which D-186 §2 refuses to carry into a module's own
  bundle, where it would read as that module's answer rather than as an unwritten sentence. Four
  of the eight are replaced by real prose in both languages in the receiving module's own bundle:
  - `errors.SYSTEM_ATTRIBUTE_SET_IMMUTABLE` in `@endora-commerce/mod-catalog`
  - `errors.CANNOT_DEMOTE_LAST_ADMIN` and `errors.CANNOT_REMOVE_LAST_ADMIN` in
    `@endora-commerce/mod-customer-accounts`
  - `errors.CURRENCY_MISMATCH` in `@endora-commerce/mod-orders`

  The other four — `TWO_FACTOR_REQUIRED`, `TWO_FACTOR_REQUIRED_BY_ROLE`, `ALREADY_SUBSCRIBED` and
  `PROMOTION_INVALID` — are codes nothing in the platform raises, so there was no refusal to
  describe and the placeholder is deleted without a replacement. A consumer that reads those keys
  out of `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`'s bundle directly will no longer find them; nothing in the
  platform produced the codes they belonged to.

- eeb6a47: Four zone members for the category editor, the product editor and the sales-channel editor.

  `@endora-commerce/contracts` adds four members to `AdminZoneNameSchema`, each with its
  entry in `AdminZonePropsMap`:

  | Member                         | Props                                       | Rendered by                                           |
  | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
  | `category.editor.after`        | `CategoryEditorZoneProps { categoryId }`    | the category editor's form, after its save/cancel row |
  | `product.editor.pricing.after` | `ProductEditorZoneProps` (reused)           | the end of the product editor's Pricing tab           |
  | `product.editor.channels`      | `ProductEditorZoneProps` (reused)           | the body of the product editor's Channels tab         |
  | `sales_channel.editor.after`   | `SalesChannelEditorZoneProps { channelId }` | below the sales-channel editor's identity form        |

  `CategoryEditorZoneProps` and `SalesChannelEditorZoneProps` are new exported interfaces.
  `ProductEditorZoneProps` is reused for the two product members rather than aliased: a props
  type is the shape the mount carries, and two places in one editor that both carry a product
  id carry the same shape.

  ```tsx
  import { AdminZone, useAdminZone } from '@endora-commerce/admin-kit/zones';

  // A tab whose body is a zone shows its button by counting the zone, never by
  // naming the module that fills it.
  const contributions = useAdminZone('product.editor.channels', { productId });
  // …
  <AdminZone name="product.editor.channels" props={{ productId }} />;
  ```

  `@endora-commerce/mod-price-lists` gains an `./admin` subpath declaring two zone
  contributions — `category.editor.after` and `product.editor.pricing.after`, both at
  `price_lists:read` — and takes `DisplayModeOverrideRow` and `LinkedPriceListsPanel` with it.

  **`DisplayModeOverrideRow` loses its `label` and `inheritHint` props**, and that is a copy
  change an operator will see. A host cannot hand its own wording to a contributor it does not
  know, so the control renders `priceLists.displayMode.rowLabel` in every place it appears.
  Two screens read different words than before: the category editor, which passed `catalog`'s
  `categories.priceDisplayMode.label` / `.help` (both keys are removed from `catalog`'s
  bundle — hence its `patch`), and the product editor's Pricing tab, which passed this
  module's own `priceLists.linked.displayModeLabel` / `.displayModeHint`. Those two `core`
  keys are now read by nothing; they are left in place because the same props are still passed
  by `organizations`' detail screen, whose conversion is a separate merge request.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels` gains an `./admin` subpath declaring one contribution,
  `product.editor.channels` at `sales_channels:read`, and takes `EntityChannelMembership` with
  it. Its four calls are rebuilt from the published `apiClient` rather than moving
  `sales-channels-client`, so the package reaches nothing in the admin application.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-inventory` gains an `./admin` subpath declaring one contribution,
  `sales_channel.editor.after` at `inventory:read`, and takes the panel formerly at
  `admin/src/modules/warehouses/ChannelMembershipPanel.tsx`. Its own
  `isVisible({ module: 'inventory', requiredPermission: 'inventory:read' })` gate is gone —
  the zone renderer applies presence and that code before the chunk is fetched — while the
  `inventory:write` half stays, because a contribution declares one code and the panel offers
  a read view and write actions behind two.

  No contribution declares a `match`: each names a member exactly one host mounts, and `match`
  narrows the mounts of one place.

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.
