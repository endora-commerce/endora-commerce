## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- 8f61a6b: Every published package now ships its own `LICENSE` and `README.md`.

  npm force-includes a file named `LICENSE` into the tarball exactly as it does `README.md`,
  whatever `files` says, so the text has to be in the package directory and not only at the
  repository root — `LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md` states that rule and, until this release, no package
  obeyed it. Measured on `master`: **0** of the 82 publishable packages carried a `LICENSE` and
  **14** carried a `README.md`, so every tarball shipped without licence text and 68 registry
  pages would have rendered empty.

  Both files are **generated**, by `pnpm --filter backend run manifests:generate`, and refused
  when stale by `manifests:check` in the `quality` job:
  - the `LICENSE` is the repository's root `LICENSE`, copied verbatim — the same single source
    the `license: MIT` field is already rendered from. A package that declares a licence of its
    own in the `SEE LICENSE IN <file>` form is skipped and keeps the file it names.
  - the `README.md` is rendered from what the package's own manifest declares: its description,
    its module id where it has one, every published subpath with what that layer holds, its peer
    dependencies with the optional ones marked, the locales its `i18n/` carries and what the
    tarball ships. A `README.md` **without** the generated marker on its first line is a human's
    and is never rewritten — the fourteen that existed are untouched.

  Five module packages also get their npm description back. `@endora-commerce/mod-blog`,
  `mod-credit-limits`, `mod-dhl-parcel`, `mod-google-analytics` and `mod-quote-requests` carried
  the note written when they were moved out of `backend/src/modules` — _"the first module to
  leave backend/src/modules … the manifest id stays identity of record"_ — as the sentence a
  registry shows under the package name. Each now carries the sentence its own module manifest
  declares, which is where `descriptionFor` seeds one from in the first place.

  No API changes, no new dependency, no behaviour change: what moves is what the tarball carries
  and what a package page says.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 0eeb9b5: Require Node >= 22.18.0.

  The previous floor was 22.17.0, which MikroORM 7 sets. 22.18.0 is the first release that
  strips TypeScript types without a flag, and that is what loads a deployment's overlay module:
  in a scaffolded instance `apps/` is outside every compiled member, so the unit the platform
  `import()`s is the client's own `.ts`. On 22.17.x that import throws
  `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` and the process dies before it listens. Emitting a `.js` beside
  the client's source was measured and refused — the overlay loader resolves `.js` before `.ts`
  while the divergence derivation admits both, so the sibling doubles every seam site in the
  report.

  Derived by probing 22.17.0, 22.17.1, 22.18.0 and 22.19.0 against a `.ts` module imported with
  no flag; 22.18.0 is the lowest that loads it.

  If you run 22.17.x, upgrade to 22.18 or later. Nothing else in these packages changed.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 02838b7: Nine modules now declare the environment inputs they own, in `manifest.env`, so a
  client who installs them can be told what to put in their `.env`. Each declaration
  carries an English and a Polish sentence, a requirement, and — for an `optional`
  one — what is lost without it.

  `health_checks` was the tenth until D-229 dissolved it into the platform; its two
  declarations went with it, and `search`'s `MEILISEARCH_URL` went with them,
  because the platform now declares that name and a module may not describe a
  platform input a second time.

  Nothing changes at runtime: no module reads a new variable and none changes how it
  reads an existing one. What changes is that the requirement is now on the wire, in
  the manifest the platform already carries, and reaches a consumer through the
  package's own `exports` map.

  Every module here declares only what it **owns**. The seven platform-owned names
  these modules read — `NODE_ENV`, `BACKEND_ROLE`, `STOREFRONT_BASE_URL`,
  `PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`, `BACKEND_PUBLIC_URL`, `REVALIDATE_SECRET` and
  `SETTINGS_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` — are declared by `@endora-commerce/platform` and
  are deliberately not repeated here.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 55332ec: `mfa` resolves its own identity reads; `MfaActorBridge` is gone.

  The exported `MfaActorBridge` interface is **removed**. A composition no longer
  contributes `mfaActorBridge`, and the module resolves the six answers itself:
  `customerActorResolver` and `adminContextResolver` off the container, and
  `customerAccountReadPort`, `adminUserReadPort`, `customerPasswordVerificationPort`
  and `adminPasswordVerificationPort` through `lazyPort`. Both owners are already in
  this module's manifest `dependencies`.

  Consumers of `mfaModule`'s option object: `resolveAdminActor`,
  `resolveOrganizationCustomerIds`, `resolveOrgAdmin`, `resolveAccountEmail` and
  `verifyAccountPassword` are now **required** where they were optional. The
  optionality was a live divergence rather than a capability — the two composition
  roots disagreed about the last two, so under test an authenticator entry was
  labelled with the account id instead of its e-mail address and the password branch
  of the 2FA-disable re-authentication did not exist.

  Before:

  ```ts
  composedModules.contribute({
    mfaActorBridge: { resolveCustomerActor, resolveAdminActor, resolveOrgAdmin /* … */ },
  });
  ```

  After: contribute nothing. `mfa` reads what it needs.

- e27bf6c: Every package that ships scannable UI now publishes its own Tailwind `@source`
  declarations at a new `./tailwind.css` subpath.

  A host compiling this package's utility classes no longer has to know where the
  package's sources are. Import the subpath from the stylesheet that builds your
  admin, and the package names its own layers:

  ```css
  @import 'tailwindcss';
  @import '@endora-commerce/mod-blog/tailwind.css';
  ```

  `@source` resolves relative to the stylesheet that declares it, so the paths hold
  wherever the package is installed. The file is generated from the package's layer
  inventory, ships in the tarball beside `package.json`, and its `dist` line is the one
  that matters to you — the `src` line beside it is inert in a published package and
  exists so that a checkout of this repository keeps scanning source in `dev`.

  **Nothing is removed or renamed**: every existing subpath resolves exactly as before.
  What is new is the obligation on the _host_ side, and it is a build error rather than a
  silent one. Before this, a host reached these packages with a glob over the monorepo
  (`@source "../../packages/**"`), which named a directory no installed tree has —
  and Tailwind reports nothing at all about a source that matches nothing, so such a host
  built green and rendered every screen unstyled. A host that now names a package that is
  not installed gets `Can't resolve`, and one whose tarball omits the file gets
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.

  `@endora-commerce/cms-components` deliberately does **not** publish this subpath. It
  ships a finished, prefixed stylesheet at `./styles.css` and must not also be scanned by
  its host.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 73d0887: Publish `MfaEnrolmentStatePort`, and make `twoFactorEnabled` the live enrolment.

  `activeSubjectIds(subjectType: MfaSubjectType, subjectIds: readonly string[]):
Promise<string[]>` answers which of the given subjects hold an active second
  factor, on the `mfaEnrolmentStatePort` container. Batched rather than per row,
  because every caller is a list surface; the answer is plain ids, because
  `MfaEnrolment` carries the encrypted TOTP secret and no consumer has business
  holding it.

  New surface on `mfa` — nothing is removed there. A consumer resolves it with
  `lazyPort<MfaEnrolmentStatePort>(ctx, 'mfaEnrolmentStatePort')` and declares the
  edge; both consumers in this repository declare it `degrades-without`, because
  `mfa` is deactivatable and a locked consumer binding it would make the operator's
  MFA switch a dead one.

  **Two mappers gained a required parameter, and that is a breaking change to a
  call, not to a wire shape.** `toAdminUserRecord(admin, twoFactorEnabled)` and
  `toCustomerAccountRecord(account, twoFactorEnabled)` no longer derive the field
  themselves; each package also exports a batching helper
  (`toAdminUserRecords` / `toCustomerAccountRecords`, plus
  `toOneCustomerAccountRecord`) that takes the reader and does one `mfa` read per
  response. The parameter has no default deliberately: it replaces a derivation
  that was silently wrong, and a default would let the next call site reintroduce
  it. Two service constructors take the reader as a new argument —
  `CustomerAccountReadService(emFactory, twoFactorEnrolments)` and
  `AdminUserReadService(emFactory, twoFactorEnrolments)`, with the same addition on
  `CustomerAccountMemberWriteService`, `CustomerAccountLifecycleWriteService` and
  `CustomerAccountAdminSearchService`.

  `twoFactorEnabled: boolean` is unchanged on every response and on both published
  records; what changed is where the value comes from. It was
  `Boolean(x.twoFactorConfirmedAt)` — a column with no writer on either identity
  table, whose last non-null writer was the superseded customer TOTP path deleted
  on 2026-08-25 — so the field was a provably constant `false`. `/admin-users`
  reported no second factor for an administrator who had enrolled an hour earlier,
  and `GET /api/v1/me/customer` told a buyer their own account was unprotected
  while it was not.

  `two_factor_confirmed_at` is now read by nothing on either table. Dropping the
  two columns is a separate migration and is not in this change.

- e5ae42c: `mfa`, `carts`, `audit_logs`, `admin_users` and `admin_roles` ship their admin surfaces, on a
  new `./admin` subpath each.

  Each of the five now exports `contributions` from `@endora-commerce/mod-<id>/admin` as an
  `AdminContributions` object — six routes and three sidebar entries between them. Every
  component is a dynamic-import factory, so a consumer's bundler emits one chunk per screen.

  Six things a consumer has to know:
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-admin-roles/admin` declares a sidebar entry and no route.** The
    `/admin-roles` screen is served by `GET /api/v1/admin/admin-roles` in `admin_users`, so
    `@endora-commerce/mod-admin-users/admin` declares that route alongside its own
    `/admin-users`, while `admin_roles` declares the sidebar entry and the palette action that
    advertise it. All three arrays of `AdminContributions` are optional and a nav-only
    contribution is supported; a consumer rendering the registry needs both packages for the
    roles screen to be both reachable and advertised.
  - **Three sidebar labels moved namespace.** `appShell.nav.users`, `appShell.nav.roles` and
    `appShell.nav.auditLog` were in `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`'s shared `core` bundle; they
    are now `nav.adminUsers.label`, `nav.adminRoles.label` and `nav.auditLog.label` in each
    package's own `i18n/`, resolved in the module's own scope. Anything reading an old key gets
    a raw key back. The text is unchanged in both languages, and the screens' own keys did not
    move.
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-admin-users` and `@endora-commerce/mod-audit-logs` ship an `i18n/`
    directory for the first time**, and their manifests declare `i18n.bundlesDir` accordingly.
    A consumer that mirrored `files` by hand needs the new directory.
  - **Three packages declare `actions` for the first time**: `open-admin-users`,
    `open-admin-roles` and `open-audit-log`. They are ⌘K palette entries, resolved by the
    server against the effective enabled-set, and they pay three of the fifteen remaining
    entries in this repository's Principle XVI debt. `mfa` and `carts` still declare none —
    neither contributes a sidebar entry, which is that debt's population.
  - **`@endora-commerce/contracts` adds `ShieldCheck` to `KnownIconNameSchema`**, and
    `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`'s `resolveIcon` maps it. Additive: no existing name changes,
    and a consumer validating an icon name against the old enum keeps working. It is needed
    because a nav entry declares its glyph **by name**, so keeping the one the sidebar already
    drew meant adding the name rather than substituting one already on the list.
  - **All five packages now peer on `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`, `react` and, where a screen
    routes, `react-router-dom` and `lucide-react`.** They are peers rather than dependencies
    for the reason `page-builder-core` is: the application must resolve exactly one copy, and a
    provider in one copy against a consumer in the other is a `null` context at runtime rather
    than a type error.

- 661e80d: Fourteen new packages: the **second** batch of modules to leave `backend/src/modules/`
  (feature 080, T040b). Five moved one at a time, then ten together; these fourteen are the
  same shape as the ten, and the properties below hold fourteen times over.

  **One changeset, not fourteen**, for the reason batch one gives: a changeset is written for
  the consumer of a package, and a package that did not exist a moment ago has no upgrader to
  instruct. What genuinely differs per package is its layer inventory, and that is the table.

  Every subpath is compiled output (D-164); none has a root wildcard; each package's `.` is
  its `manifest.ts`, where the generated manifest index reads the module's identity, its
  `dependencies`, its permission codes, its command-palette actions, its settings and its
  activation control.

  **`./backend` publishes `registerModule(ctx)` and an `entities` array, and no entity class by
  name** (D-168) — type-only exports included, which this batch measured rather than assumed:
  two packages published their entities' row types so the dev seed could name them, and
  `module-package-entity-surface.test.ts` refused both, in as many words — _"that is the one
  thing that makes a foreign module's `import type { … }` compile"_. The exports are gone and
  the seed takes each class off the published array by name.

  **One of the fourteen owns no table and says so with an empty array rather than by
  omission.** `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels` exports `entities: readonly never[] = []`.
  The distinction is not cosmetic: the platform's package loader answers a _missing_ export
  with `[]`, so "this module has no table" and "somebody forgot the array" would otherwise
  arrive as one silence, whose only symptom is a query against a table nobody created.

  **One package publishes a type on `./backend` that is not an entity**, and it is there
  because a composition root has to name a contribution it supplies:
  `@endora-commerce/mod-shopping-lists` re-exports `ShoppingListService`. A root cannot reach
  a package's internal file — `rootDir` makes a relative specifier into `packages/` TS6059
  even for an `import type` — so a contribution shape has to be on a published subpath or it
  is unnameable.

  **Two packages declare a `@fastify/*` dependency nothing imports.**
  `@endora-commerce/mod-mfa` peers on `@fastify/cookie` and `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa` on
  `@fastify/multipart`, because `reply.setCookie`, `request.isMultipart()` and
  `request.file()` are declaration-merging augmentations rather than imports. Inside the
  application those arrived ambiently through the host's own dependency; a package compiles
  against its own manifest, where an unnamed dependency does not exist. Both write
  `import type {} from '@fastify/…'`, which is type-only: the plugin is still the host's to
  register.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter` and `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa` also carry a companion
  `@types/*` in `devDependencies`** — `@types/nodemailer` and `@types/web-push` — which the
  manifest generator now derives. Nothing imports a `@types` package; the compiler finds it
  through `node_modules/@types`, which inside a package is the package's own declaration, so
  a module importing a JS-only library did not build until this landed.

### Patch Changes

- 5d9bb88: Error-code ownership: Tier B's six already-bundled modules declare the codes they own, and eight
  placeholder sentences leave the platform bundle.

  `manifest.errorCodes` gains seven codes on `@endora-commerce/mod-customer-accounts`
  (`ACCOUNT_BLOCKED`, `CANNOT_DEMOTE_LAST_ADMIN`, `CANNOT_REMOVE_LAST_ADMIN` and the four
  `CUSTOMER_*` record codes), six on `@endora-commerce/mod-catalog` (`BULK_TOO_LARGE`, the three
  `PACKAGING_UNIT_*` codes, `SELECTION_TOO_LARGE`, `SYSTEM_ATTRIBUTE_SET_IMMUTABLE`), three on
  `@endora-commerce/mod-orders` (`CURRENCY_MISMATCH`, `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REQUIRED`,
  `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED`), two on `@endora-commerce/mod-mfa` (`TWO_FACTOR_REQUIRED`,
  `TWO_FACTOR_REQUIRED_BY_ROLE`), one on `@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter`
  (`ALREADY_SUBSCRIBED`) and one on `@endora-commerce/mod-promotions` (`PROMOTION_INVALID`);
  `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n` drops the same twenty from its own declaration, which is what
  decides where the error envelope looks for a sentence (D-129's remaining sweep, MR 4 of eight;
  D-121 tiers T1 and T2; D-186 §1 and §2 in `specs/080-f4-real-scope/rulings.md`;
  `specs/090-module-owned-error-codes/d129-sweep.md`).

  `@endora-commerce/mod-customer-accounts`, `@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-promotions` declare an error code for the first time. No wire shape moves:
  `error.code` is unchanged for all twenty.

  **Eight sentences are deleted from `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`'s bundle, and this is
  operator-visible.** Each was the error code rewritten twice — `"Currency Mismatch."` in `en` and
  `"Błąd: currency mismatch."` in `pl` — which D-186 §2 refuses to carry into a module's own
  bundle, where it would read as that module's answer rather than as an unwritten sentence. Four
  of the eight are replaced by real prose in both languages in the receiving module's own bundle:
  - `errors.SYSTEM_ATTRIBUTE_SET_IMMUTABLE` in `@endora-commerce/mod-catalog`
  - `errors.CANNOT_DEMOTE_LAST_ADMIN` and `errors.CANNOT_REMOVE_LAST_ADMIN` in
    `@endora-commerce/mod-customer-accounts`
  - `errors.CURRENCY_MISMATCH` in `@endora-commerce/mod-orders`

  The other four — `TWO_FACTOR_REQUIRED`, `TWO_FACTOR_REQUIRED_BY_ROLE`, `ALREADY_SUBSCRIBED` and
  `PROMOTION_INVALID` — are codes nothing in the platform raises, so there was no refusal to
  describe and the placeholder is deleted without a replacement. A consumer that reads those keys
  out of `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`'s bundle directly will no longer find them; nothing in the
  platform produced the codes they belonged to.

- b8bd8c7: `mfa` declares the ten error codes it owns.

  `manifest.ts` gains an `errorCodes` array — feature 090 Phase 3
  (`specs/090-module-owned-error-codes/`). Nothing the package exports changes
  shape. The observable difference for a consumer is that this module's error
  sentences are now routed by its own declaration rather than only by the prefix
  chain in `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`, which continues to answer identically for
  every one of them: the list is the chain's own answer, copied verbatim from the
  frozen capture, and is asserted equal to it in both directions.

  `TWO_FACTOR_REQUIRED` and `TWO_FACTOR_REQUIRED_BY_ROLE` are deliberately not
  among them. Both name this module's subject, neither carries the `MFA_` prefix,
  so both fall off the end of the chain to `core` — and the declaration follows
  the chain's answer rather than the noun.

  All ten already carry a written sentence in both `en` and `pl` in this package's
  own `i18n/` bundles, so no sentence moves and none is added. No `tokens`: none
  of the fourteen raise sites of these ten codes passes a fourth argument to
  `HttpError` at all, so there is no `details.code` for the envelope to read.

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.
