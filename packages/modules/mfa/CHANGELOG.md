### Minor Changes

- 9260c36: An administrator's sessions are revoked when the credential behind them is withdrawn.

  Three writes used to leave every session of the account answering:

  - **Changing your own password** (`PATCH /api/v1/admin/me`) replaced the hash and nothing else, so
    a browser signed in elsewhere — the one the password was being changed because of — stayed
    signed in for up to thirty days. It now revokes **every other session of the account**: the
    sign-ins on other browsers and devices and the impersonation sessions the administrator started.
    The session the request was made from is kept, no new cookie is issued, and the profile screen
    stays open. A refused change (wrong or missing `currentPassword`) and a name-only edit revoke
    nothing.
  - **Deactivating an administrator** (`PATCH /api/v1/admin/admin-users/:id` with
    `status: 'inactive'`) and **deleting one** (`DELETE /api/v1/admin/admin-users/:id`) now revoke
    every session of the account. A permission check already refused an inactive account, but a
    route gated on the session alone — `GET` and `PATCH /api/v1/admin/me` among them — kept
    answering it, and reactivating the account brought the old sessions back.

  A peer reset (`POST /api/v1/admin/admin-users/:id/password`) already revoked every session and is
  unchanged. API keys are not sessions and are not touched; neither is the account's second factor.

  **A revoked session could come back.** `SessionService.destroyAllForAdmin` and
  `destroyAllForCustomer` cleared the Redis cache entries and then deleted the rows, so a request from
  a session being revoked could read the row in between and cache it again — after which it answered
  from the cache until its thirty-day expiry. Rows are deleted first now, and `loadSession` looks for
  the row again after filling the cache and takes the entry back out when it is gone.

  **Logins begun with the old password are withdrawn.** A pending second-factor challenge or setup
  ticket issued after the old password verified could still be completed after a password change, a
  peer reset, a deactivation or a delete. `MfaLoginPort` gains a required method,
  `invalidatePending(subject)` (**breaking for implementers**), which `mfa` implements with a
  per-subject generation counter in its challenge store, and `AdminUserService` calls it wherever it
  revokes sessions. `AdminUserService`'s constructor takes the lazily resolved MFA port as an optional
  fifth argument.

  **Write first, revoke second.** The self-service change, the peer reset, deactivation and deletion
  now persist the new state and then revoke, where the peer reset used to revoke first: a sign-in with
  the old password between the two steps kept a session nothing revoked. A refusal from the session
  port therefore surfaces as the request's error with the new password already in force.

  **Audit.** A self-service password change is now recorded as `admin_user.change_password` with
  `via: 'self_service'` — the action a peer reset already records with `via: 'peer_reset'` — where it
  used to be an `admin_user.update` indistinguishable from a rename. The entry carries neither the
  password nor its hash. A request that changes the name as well records an `admin_user.update`
  entry beside it; a password-only request no longer records one.

  **A session of an account that is not active is refused, revoked or not.** Revocation is a step
  each write has to remember, so the admin guard no longer relies on it: `requireAdmin` and
  `requireAdminAny` answer `401 UNAUTHORIZED` to a session whose administrator account is
  deactivated, deleted or gone. **This changes a status code:** a permission-gated route used to
  answer such a session `403 FORBIDDEN`, and a route with no permission code answered it in full. An
  active account that lacks the permission is still answered 403. The extra account read is made
  only on a route with no permission code and after a refused permission check, so a granted
  permission costs what it did. While `admin_roles` or `admin_users` is absent from the deployment the
  check is not made — it has nobody to ask — so `GET /api/v1/admin/module-presence` keeps answering in
  that state as before.

  **A new password equal to the current one is refused** on `PATCH /api/v1/admin/me` with
  `400 NEW_PASSWORD_UNCHANGED` ("The new password is the same as the current one. Choose a different
  password." / "Nowe hasło jest takie samo jak obecne. Wybierz inne hasło."). It would have reported
  a change, and signed the other sessions out, without changing the credential. The check runs after
  the current password is verified. The buyer-side change-password route and the peer reset do not
  make this check: the peer does not know the target's password, and comparing would tell them.

  **Log redaction.** The request logger censored `*.password`, `*.passwordHash` and `*.secret` but not
  `*.currentPassword` or `*.newPassword`, the two other names a password travels under in a request
  body. Both are on the list now, which `buildServer` and `createLogger` share instead of each
  carrying its own copy.

  **API — two breaking changes, named first.**

  - `AdminPermissionChecker` in `@endora-commerce/platform` gains a required method,
    `isActiveAdministrator(adminUserId): Promise<boolean>`; `PermissionService` in
    `@endora-commerce/mod-admin-roles` implements it. A hand-written checker passed to
    `createRequireAdmin` / `createRequireAdminAny` has to add it.
  - `AdminAuthService.changePassword` in `@endora-commerce/mod-admin-users` is **removed**, and the
    class's constructor loses its fourth argument (the audit port). The method had no caller,
    answered a wrong current password with 401 and revoked nothing; `AdminUserService.updateSelf` is
    the one implementation.
  - `AuthSessionPort.destroyAllForAdmin` in `@endora-commerce/contracts` takes an optional second
    argument, `{ exceptSessionId }` (`AuthDestroyAllForAdminOptions`), which spares that one session
    when it is one of the administrator's own; `SessionService.destroyAllForAdmin` in
    `@endora-commerce/mod-auth` implements it. A port implementation that ignores the argument still
    type-checks but revokes the calling session too.
  - `AdminUserService.updateSelf` takes an optional third argument, `{ sessionCookieValue }`, from
    which it works out which session to keep.
  - `ERROR_CODES.NEW_PASSWORD_UNCHANGED` joins `@endora-commerce/contracts`, owned by `admin_users`.

  A refused password change is not written to the audit log, as a failed sign-in is not.

  **Admin UI.** After a password change the profile screen says that the other sessions were signed
  out (`profile.info.passwordChanged`, English and Polish) instead of "Profile updated."

- 560f2e3: More credential changes withdraw the sessions and pending sign-ins obtained before them.

  - **`admin_users create` run again for an existing account** replaces the password, so it now
    ends every session of that account and withdraws its pending second-factor challenges and
    setup tickets, through the same path as a peer reset. The write is audited as
    `admin_user.change_password` with `via: 'cli'` and no acting administrator. Creating a new
    account is unchanged.
  - **Removing a second factor.** Disabling your own two-factor authentication
    (`POST /api/v1/admin/account/mfa/disable`, `POST /api/v1/account/mfa/disable`) ends every other
    session of the account and keeps the one the request was made from. An administrator's reset of
    a customer's second factor (`POST /api/v1/admin/customers/:customerId/mfa/reset`, and the bulk
    route for each account it actually resets) ends every session of that customer. Both withdraw
    the account's pending challenges and setup tickets. Enrolling a factor ends no session, and a
    disable or reset that removes nothing ends none either.
  - **Customer password change** (`POST /api/v1/me/customer/change-password`,
    `POST /api/v1/me/password`) ends every other session of the account and keeps the calling one.
    **Redeeming a reset token** (`POST /api/v1/auth/password-reset/confirm`) ends all of them. Both
    mark every other outstanding reset token of the account as consumed and withdraw its pending
    second-factor challenges and setup tickets.

  In every case the new state is persisted first and the sessions are revoked after it.

  Port changes, all additive: `AuthSessionPort.destroyAllForCustomer` takes an optional
  `{ exceptSessionId }` (`AuthDestroyAllForCustomerOptions`), mirroring `destroyAllForAdmin`;
  `CustomerAuthPort.changePassword` takes an optional fourth argument
  `{ sessionCookieValue }` (`CustomerChangePasswordContext`) naming the session to keep — a caller
  that omits it keeps none. No port member was removed or changed incompatibly.

  Not ports, but changed for anyone constructing these classes directly: `PasswordResetService`'s
  constructor takes the session port as its second argument (the audit port moved to third), and
  `MfaEnrolmentService.disable` returns whether a factor was removed.

### Patch Changes

- 18ae962: Repeated wrong passwords and wrong second-factor codes for an administrator account are now
  throttled. Until now the only limit in front of `POST /api/v1/auth/admin/login` was the global
  ceiling of 1000 requests a minute per address, so a password could be tried a thousand times a
  minute; and the second step's budget of five codes belonged to one challenge, so a new challenge —
  one more password request — bought five more codes.

  **What changes for a caller.** After five wrong attempts from one address on one account, or twenty
  on one account from all addresses together, the attempt is answered
  `429 ADMIN_AUTHENTICATION_THROTTLED` with a `Retry-After` header and
  `error.details.retryAfterSeconds`. The delay is one minute, then doubles with each further wrong
  attempt up to fifteen minutes; the count is cleared by a successful attempt and otherwise forgotten
  thirty minutes after the first wrong one. A correct password or code is refused too while a delay
  is running — it is not checked — and an e-mail address that belongs to no administrator is throttled
  identically. Nothing is locked permanently. An IPv6 client is counted by its /64.

  At most five attempts from one address (twenty for one account) are checked at the same time; one
  beyond that is answered 429 with `Retry-After: 1`, unchecked, and nothing is counted for it.

  It applies to `POST /api/v1/auth/admin/login`, the current password on `PATCH /api/v1/admin/me`,
  `POST /api/v1/auth/admin/mfa/verify`,
  `POST /api/v1/admin/account/mfa/disable` (password or code) and
  `POST /api/v1/admin/account/mfa/recovery-codes/regenerate`. Passwords and codes are counted
  separately. The customer routes are unchanged.

  **Known devices.** A completed administrator sign-in sets a new cookie, `b2b_admin_device`: signed
  with the server's cookie secret, `httpOnly`, 90 days. It is not a session and grants nothing. An
  attempt that carries it is counted against that device's own budget of five and not against the
  account-wide twenty, so wrong passwords sent by somebody else cannot keep an administrator out of a
  device they have signed in on before. It stops being honoured when the account's password changes,
  and is not honoured while the account is deactivated; a second-factor reset does not revoke it.
  Only a password sign-in sets it, so an account that signs in only through Google or Microsoft never
  has a known device. A device the account has never been signed in on can still be
  delayed by somebody who knows the e-mail address and sends twenty wrong passwords from four or more
  addresses.

  **For an operator.**

  - `pnpm run cli admin_users unlock --email=<e>`, from the root of an instance
    (`node dist/cli.js admin_users unlock --email=<e>` in a production image), clears every count for
    one account. Its first line of output names the Redis it acted on (host, port, database index).
  - Behind a reverse proxy, set `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` or `TRUSTED_PROXY_ADDRESSES`: without it every
    client shares the proxy's address.
  - Each delay that starts for an existing account writes one audit row,
    `admin_user.authentication_throttled`, with the factor, the scope (`address`, `account` or
    `device`) and the delay. Refused attempts write nothing.
  - When Redis does not answer within three seconds the attempt is refused with
    `503 ADMIN_AUTHENTICATION_UNAVAILABLE`.

  **In `@endora-commerce/contracts`.** New: `AdminAuthenticationThrottlePort` (container name
  `adminAuthenticationThrottlePort`, owned by `admin_users`) with `verify` and `issueKnownDevice`;
  `AdminAuthenticationAttempt`, `AdminAuthenticationOrigin`, `AdminAuthenticationCheckResult` and
  `AdminAuthenticationFactor`; `ADMIN_KNOWN_DEVICE_COOKIE_NAME` and
  `ADMIN_KNOWN_DEVICE_MAX_AGE_SECONDS`; and the error codes `ADMIN_AUTHENTICATION_THROTTLED` and
  `ADMIN_AUTHENTICATION_UNAVAILABLE`. A route that verifies an administrator credential adopts the
  throttle with one call:

  ```ts
  const ok = await throttle.verify(
    { factor: 'password', account: admin.email, ip: request.ip, knownDevice },
    async () => ({ ok: await verifyPassword(admin.passwordHash, typed), adminUserId: admin.id }),
  );
  ```

  `AdminPasswordVerificationPort.verifyPassword` takes an optional third argument,
  `context?: AdminAuthenticationOrigin`, and now rejects with the 429 or the 503 above instead of
  always resolving to a boolean.

- 35b6a72: The second sign-in step checks no more codes per challenge than its budget, however they arrive.

  A challenge carries a budget of five codes. The budget was read, the code checked, and the budget
  written back afterwards — so codes sent at the same time were all checked against the same unspent
  budget: thirty parallel requests had thirty codes checked on one challenge. This applied to
  customers and administrators alike; for administrators the account's authentication throttle
  bounded it, for customers nothing did.

  An attempt is now taken from the budget in one atomic step (a script that counts it and arms the counter's expiry) before the code is looked at. Of any
  number of codes sent together exactly five are checked; the rest are refused with
  `429 MFA_TOO_MANY_ATTEMPTS` and the challenge is burned; a challenge that is no longer there still answers `400 MFA_INVALID_CHALLENGE`. An attempt that was refused before its
  code was checked — the administrator throttle's 429 — is given back, as before.

  `ChallengeStore.recordFailedAttempt` is replaced by `takeAttempt` and `returnAttempt`.

### Patch Changes

- 69a3717: The `fastify` peer is now `^5.11.0` instead of `^5`, so an install can no longer resolve Fastify 5.0–5.10. On those versions an async route handler that calls `reply.send()` without `return` throws `ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT` as an uncaught exception from Fastify's onSend hook runner, and the process crash-loops; Fastify 5.11.0 catches that error and the server keeps running. An instance scaffolded by `endora new instance` now declares `fastify@^5.11.0` as well. Nothing to do on upgrade unless your project pins Fastify below 5.11 — move it to `^5.11.0` (the repository itself runs 5.12.5).

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- b8ad861: `POST /admin/organizations/:organizationId/mfa-policy` authorises the organization it is given — out of scope now answers `404`

  **If a scoped admin in your deployment sets per-organization TOTP enforcement for organizations
  it is not assigned to, this release makes those calls fail with `404 NOT_FOUND`.** One route
  handler changed; no entity, service, DTO or migration did.

  The route read `:organizationId` out of the path and wrote `MfaOrganizationPolicy` for it with
  no authorisation beyond the `mfa:manage` permission code. `MfaOrganizationPolicy` is
  `@GlobalEntity()` and correctly so — the row _is_ the per-organization rule, keyed by an id the
  module does not own — so no column filter could reach the write, and a permission code is not a
  tenancy boundary: an operator may put `mfa:manage` on any role. A `sales_representative`
  assigned only to organization A was measured forcing TOTP on organization B and then lifting it
  again, `200` on both.

  What changes for a consumer, in the order you will meet it:
  - **The route calls `isOrgInScope(request.params.organizationId)` and answers `404 NOT_FOUND`
    when it is false**, byte-identical to the answer a non-existent organization gets. `all` and
    `system` contexts are unaffected and keep writing any organization's policy.
  - **A scoped admin keeps the capability for its own assignments.** This is a narrowing, not a
    removal: the same actor still enforces and lifts TOTP for the organizations it is assigned.
  - **`404` rather than `403`** because the organization id addresses the resource — it is the
    path parameter and the row's own key — so nothing about existence may be disclosed. The model
    is `credit_limits`' grant route.
  - **The customer-facing `PUT /api/v1/account/organization/mfa-policy` is untouched**: it derives
    its organization from the signed-in account rather than from the request.

  `minor` rather than `major` because no package in this repository leaves `0.x` yet; in a `0.x`
  series a minor already takes every caret dependent out of range, which is the consumer-facing
  meaning of the break.

  Implements D-260/B: wherever a route accepts a tenant identity as input rather than deriving it
  from the actor, the guard has to be at that route.

### Patch Changes

- 8f61a6b: Every published package now ships its own `LICENSE` and `README.md`.

  npm force-includes a file named `LICENSE` into the tarball exactly as it does `README.md`,
  whatever `files` says, so the text has to be in the package directory and not only at the
  repository root — `LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md` states that rule and, until this release, no package
  obeyed it. Measured on `master`: **0** of the 82 publishable packages carried a `LICENSE` and
  **14** carried a `README.md`, so every tarball shipped without licence text and 68 registry
  pages would have rendered empty.

  Both files are **generated**, by `pnpm --filter backend run manifests:generate`, and refused
  when stale by `manifests:check` in the `quality` job:
  - the `LICENSE` is the repository's root `LICENSE`, copied verbatim — the same single source
    the `license: MIT` field is already rendered from. A package that declares a licence of its
    own in the `SEE LICENSE IN <file>` form is skipped and keeps the file it names.
  - the `README.md` is rendered from what the package's own manifest declares: its description,
    its module id where it has one, every published subpath with what that layer holds, its peer
    dependencies with the optional ones marked, the locales its `i18n/` carries and what the
    tarball ships. A `README.md` **without** the generated marker on its first line is a human's
    and is never rewritten — the fourteen that existed are untouched.

  Five module packages also get their npm description back. `@endora-commerce/mod-blog`,
  `mod-credit-limits`, `mod-dhl-parcel`, `mod-google-analytics` and `mod-quote-requests` carried
  the note written when they were moved out of `backend/src/modules` — _"the first module to
  leave backend/src/modules … the manifest id stays identity of record"_ — as the sentence a
  registry shows under the package name. Each now carries the sentence its own module manifest
  declares, which is where `descriptionFor` seeds one from in the first place.

  No API changes, no new dependency, no behaviour change: what moves is what the tarball carries
  and what a package page says.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 0eeb9b5: Require Node >= 22.18.0.

  The previous floor was 22.17.0, which MikroORM 7 sets. 22.18.0 is the first release that
  strips TypeScript types without a flag, and that is what loads a deployment's overlay module:
  in a scaffolded instance `apps/` is outside every compiled member, so the unit the platform
  `import()`s is the client's own `.ts`. On 22.17.x that import throws
  `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` and the process dies before it listens. Emitting a `.js` beside
  the client's source was measured and refused — the overlay loader resolves `.js` before `.ts`
  while the divergence derivation admits both, so the sibling doubles every seam site in the
  report.

  Derived by probing 22.17.0, 22.17.1, 22.18.0 and 22.19.0 against a `.ts` module imported with
  no flag; 22.18.0 is the lowest that loads it.

  If you run 22.17.x, upgrade to 22.18 or later. Nothing else in these packages changed.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 02838b7: Nine modules now declare the environment inputs they own, in `manifest.env`, so a
  client who installs them can be told what to put in their `.env`. Each declaration
  carries an English and a Polish sentence, a requirement, and — for an `optional`
  one — what is lost without it.

  `health_checks` was the tenth until D-229 dissolved it into the platform; its two
  declarations went with it, and `search`'s `MEILISEARCH_URL` went with them,
  because the platform now declares that name and a module may not describe a
  platform input a second time.

  Nothing changes at runtime: no module reads a new variable and none changes how it
  reads an existing one. What changes is that the requirement is now on the wire, in
  the manifest the platform already carries, and reaches a consumer through the
  package's own `exports` map.

  Every module here declares only what it **owns**. The seven platform-owned names
  these modules read — `NODE_ENV`, `BACKEND_ROLE`, `STOREFRONT_BASE_URL`,
  `PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`, `BACKEND_PUBLIC_URL`, `REVALIDATE_SECRET` and
  `SETTINGS_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` — are declared by `@endora-commerce/platform` and
  are deliberately not repeated here.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 55332ec: `mfa` resolves its own identity reads; `MfaActorBridge` is gone.

  The exported `MfaActorBridge` interface is **removed**. A composition no longer
  contributes `mfaActorBridge`, and the module resolves the six answers itself:
  `customerActorResolver` and `adminContextResolver` off the container, and
  `customerAccountReadPort`, `adminUserReadPort`, `customerPasswordVerificationPort`
  and `adminPasswordVerificationPort` through `lazyPort`. Both owners are already in
  this module's manifest `dependencies`.

  Consumers of `mfaModule`'s option object: `resolveAdminActor`,
  `resolveOrganizationCustomerIds`, `resolveOrgAdmin`, `resolveAccountEmail` and
  `verifyAccountPassword` are now **required** where they were optional. The
  optionality was a live divergence rather than a capability — the two composition
  roots disagreed about the last two, so under test an authenticator entry was
  labelled with the account id instead of its e-mail address and the password branch
  of the 2FA-disable re-authentication did not exist.

  Before:

  ```ts
  composedModules.contribute({
    mfaActorBridge: { resolveCustomerActor, resolveAdminActor, resolveOrgAdmin /* … */ },
  });
  ```

  After: contribute nothing. `mfa` reads what it needs.

- e27bf6c: Every package that ships scannable UI now publishes its own Tailwind `@source`
  declarations at a new `./tailwind.css` subpath.

  A host compiling this package's utility classes no longer has to know where the
  package's sources are. Import the subpath from the stylesheet that builds your
  admin, and the package names its own layers:

  ```css
  @import 'tailwindcss';
  @import '@endora-commerce/mod-blog/tailwind.css';
  ```

  `@source` resolves relative to the stylesheet that declares it, so the paths hold
  wherever the package is installed. The file is generated from the package's layer
  inventory, ships in the tarball beside `package.json`, and its `dist` line is the one
  that matters to you — the `src` line beside it is inert in a published package and
  exists so that a checkout of this repository keeps scanning source in `dev`.

  **Nothing is removed or renamed**: every existing subpath resolves exactly as before.
  What is new is the obligation on the _host_ side, and it is a build error rather than a
  silent one. Before this, a host reached these packages with a glob over the monorepo
  (`@source "../../packages/**"`), which named a directory no installed tree has —
  and Tailwind reports nothing at all about a source that matches nothing, so such a host
  built green and rendered every screen unstyled. A host that now names a package that is
  not installed gets `Can't resolve`, and one whose tarball omits the file gets
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.

  `@endora-commerce/cms-components` deliberately does **not** publish this subpath. It
  ships a finished, prefixed stylesheet at `./styles.css` and must not also be scanned by
  its host.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 73d0887: Publish `MfaEnrolmentStatePort`, and make `twoFactorEnabled` the live enrolment.

  `activeSubjectIds(subjectType: MfaSubjectType, subjectIds: readonly string[]):
Promise<string[]>` answers which of the given subjects hold an active second
  factor, on the `mfaEnrolmentStatePort` container. Batched rather than per row,
  because every caller is a list surface; the answer is plain ids, because
  `MfaEnrolment` carries the encrypted TOTP secret and no consumer has business
  holding it.

  New surface on `mfa` — nothing is removed there. A consumer resolves it with
  `lazyPort<MfaEnrolmentStatePort>(ctx, 'mfaEnrolmentStatePort')` and declares the
  edge; both consumers in this repository declare it `degrades-without`, because
  `mfa` is deactivatable and a locked consumer binding it would make the operator's
  MFA switch a dead one.

  **Two mappers gained a required parameter, and that is a breaking change to a
  call, not to a wire shape.** `toAdminUserRecord(admin, twoFactorEnabled)` and
  `toCustomerAccountRecord(account, twoFactorEnabled)` no longer derive the field
  themselves; each package also exports a batching helper
  (`toAdminUserRecords` / `toCustomerAccountRecords`, plus
  `toOneCustomerAccountRecord`) that takes the reader and does one `mfa` read per
  response. The parameter has no default deliberately: it replaces a derivation
  that was silently wrong, and a default would let the next call site reintroduce
  it. Two service constructors take the reader as a new argument —
  `CustomerAccountReadService(emFactory, twoFactorEnrolments)` and
  `AdminUserReadService(emFactory, twoFactorEnrolments)`, with the same addition on
  `CustomerAccountMemberWriteService`, `CustomerAccountLifecycleWriteService` and
  `CustomerAccountAdminSearchService`.

  `twoFactorEnabled: boolean` is unchanged on every response and on both published
  records; what changed is where the value comes from. It was
  `Boolean(x.twoFactorConfirmedAt)` — a column with no writer on either identity
  table, whose last non-null writer was the superseded customer TOTP path deleted
  on 2026-08-25 — so the field was a provably constant `false`. `/admin-users`
  reported no second factor for an administrator who had enrolled an hour earlier,
  and `GET /api/v1/me/customer` told a buyer their own account was unprotected
  while it was not.

  `two_factor_confirmed_at` is now read by nothing on either table. Dropping the
  two columns is a separate migration and is not in this change.

- e5ae42c: `mfa`, `carts`, `audit_logs`, `admin_users` and `admin_roles` ship their admin surfaces, on a
  new `./admin` subpath each.

  Each of the five now exports `contributions` from `@endora-commerce/mod-<id>/admin` as an
  `AdminContributions` object — six routes and three sidebar entries between them. Every
  component is a dynamic-import factory, so a consumer's bundler emits one chunk per screen.

  Six things a consumer has to know:
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-admin-roles/admin` declares a sidebar entry and no route.** The
    `/admin-roles` screen is served by `GET /api/v1/admin/admin-roles` in `admin_users`, so
    `@endora-commerce/mod-admin-users/admin` declares that route alongside its own
    `/admin-users`, while `admin_roles` declares the sidebar entry and the palette action that
    advertise it. All three arrays of `AdminContributions` are optional and a nav-only
    contribution is supported; a consumer rendering the registry needs both packages for the
    roles screen to be both reachable and advertised.
  - **Three sidebar labels moved namespace.** `appShell.nav.users`, `appShell.nav.roles` and
    `appShell.nav.auditLog` were in `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`'s shared `core` bundle; they
    are now `nav.adminUsers.label`, `nav.adminRoles.label` and `nav.auditLog.label` in each
    package's own `i18n/`, resolved in the module's own scope. Anything reading an old key gets
    a raw key back. The text is unchanged in both languages, and the screens' own keys did not
    move.
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-admin-users` and `@endora-commerce/mod-audit-logs` ship an `i18n/`
    directory for the first time**, and their manifests declare `i18n.bundlesDir` accordingly.
    A consumer that mirrored `files` by hand needs the new directory.
  - **Three packages declare `actions` for the first time**: `open-admin-users`,
    `open-admin-roles` and `open-audit-log`. They are ⌘K palette entries, resolved by the
    server against the effective enabled-set, and they pay three of the fifteen remaining
    entries in this repository's Principle XVI debt. `mfa` and `carts` still declare none —
    neither contributes a sidebar entry, which is that debt's population.
  - **`@endora-commerce/contracts` adds `ShieldCheck` to `KnownIconNameSchema`**, and
    `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`'s `resolveIcon` maps it. Additive: no existing name changes,
    and a consumer validating an icon name against the old enum keeps working. It is needed
    because a nav entry declares its glyph **by name**, so keeping the one the sidebar already
    drew meant adding the name rather than substituting one already on the list.
  - **All five packages now peer on `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`, `react` and, where a screen
    routes, `react-router-dom` and `lucide-react`.** They are peers rather than dependencies
    for the reason `page-builder-core` is: the application must resolve exactly one copy, and a
    provider in one copy against a consumer in the other is a `null` context at runtime rather
    than a type error.

- 661e80d: Fourteen new packages: the **second** batch of modules to leave `backend/src/modules/`
  (feature 080, T040b). Five moved one at a time, then ten together; these fourteen are the
  same shape as the ten, and the properties below hold fourteen times over.

  **One changeset, not fourteen**, for the reason batch one gives: a changeset is written for
  the consumer of a package, and a package that did not exist a moment ago has no upgrader to
  instruct. What genuinely differs per package is its layer inventory, and that is the table.

  Every subpath is compiled output (D-164); none has a root wildcard; each package's `.` is
  its `manifest.ts`, where the generated manifest index reads the module's identity, its
  `dependencies`, its permission codes, its command-palette actions, its settings and its
  activation control.

  **`./backend` publishes `registerModule(ctx)` and an `entities` array, and no entity class by
  name** (D-168) — type-only exports included, which this batch measured rather than assumed:
  two packages published their entities' row types so the dev seed could name them, and
  `module-package-entity-surface.test.ts` refused both, in as many words — _"that is the one
  thing that makes a foreign module's `import type { … }` compile"_. The exports are gone and
  the seed takes each class off the published array by name.

  **One of the fourteen owns no table and says so with an empty array rather than by
  omission.** `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels` exports `entities: readonly never[] = []`.
  The distinction is not cosmetic: the platform's package loader answers a _missing_ export
  with `[]`, so "this module has no table" and "somebody forgot the array" would otherwise
  arrive as one silence, whose only symptom is a query against a table nobody created.

  **One package publishes a type on `./backend` that is not an entity**, and it is there
  because a composition root has to name a contribution it supplies:
  `@endora-commerce/mod-shopping-lists` re-exports `ShoppingListService`. A root cannot reach
  a package's internal file — `rootDir` makes a relative specifier into `packages/` TS6059
  even for an `import type` — so a contribution shape has to be on a published subpath or it
  is unnameable.

  **Two packages declare a `@fastify/*` dependency nothing imports.**
  `@endora-commerce/mod-mfa` peers on `@fastify/cookie` and `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa` on
  `@fastify/multipart`, because `reply.setCookie`, `request.isMultipart()` and
  `request.file()` are declaration-merging augmentations rather than imports. Inside the
  application those arrived ambiently through the host's own dependency; a package compiles
  against its own manifest, where an unnamed dependency does not exist. Both write
  `import type {} from '@fastify/…'`, which is type-only: the plugin is still the host's to
  register.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter` and `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa` also carry a companion
  `@types/*` in `devDependencies`** — `@types/nodemailer` and `@types/web-push` — which the
  manifest generator now derives. Nothing imports a `@types` package; the compiler finds it
  through `node_modules/@types`, which inside a package is the package's own declaration, so
  a module importing a JS-only library did not build until this landed.

### Patch Changes

- 5d9bb88: Error-code ownership: Tier B's six already-bundled modules declare the codes they own, and eight
  placeholder sentences leave the platform bundle.

  `manifest.errorCodes` gains seven codes on `@endora-commerce/mod-customer-accounts`
  (`ACCOUNT_BLOCKED`, `CANNOT_DEMOTE_LAST_ADMIN`, `CANNOT_REMOVE_LAST_ADMIN` and the four
  `CUSTOMER_*` record codes), six on `@endora-commerce/mod-catalog` (`BULK_TOO_LARGE`, the three
  `PACKAGING_UNIT_*` codes, `SELECTION_TOO_LARGE`, `SYSTEM_ATTRIBUTE_SET_IMMUTABLE`), three on
  `@endora-commerce/mod-orders` (`CURRENCY_MISMATCH`, `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REQUIRED`,
  `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED`), two on `@endora-commerce/mod-mfa` (`TWO_FACTOR_REQUIRED`,
  `TWO_FACTOR_REQUIRED_BY_ROLE`), one on `@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter`
  (`ALREADY_SUBSCRIBED`) and one on `@endora-commerce/mod-promotions` (`PROMOTION_INVALID`);
  `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n` drops the same twenty from its own declaration, which is what
  decides where the error envelope looks for a sentence (D-129's remaining sweep, MR 4 of eight;
  D-121 tiers T1 and T2; D-186 §1 and §2 in `specs/080-f4-real-scope/rulings.md`;
  `specs/090-module-owned-error-codes/d129-sweep.md`).

  `@endora-commerce/mod-customer-accounts`, `@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-promotions` declare an error code for the first time. No wire shape moves:
  `error.code` is unchanged for all twenty.

  **Eight sentences are deleted from `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`'s bundle, and this is
  operator-visible.** Each was the error code rewritten twice — `"Currency Mismatch."` in `en` and
  `"Błąd: currency mismatch."` in `pl` — which D-186 §2 refuses to carry into a module's own
  bundle, where it would read as that module's answer rather than as an unwritten sentence. Four
  of the eight are replaced by real prose in both languages in the receiving module's own bundle:
  - `errors.SYSTEM_ATTRIBUTE_SET_IMMUTABLE` in `@endora-commerce/mod-catalog`
  - `errors.CANNOT_DEMOTE_LAST_ADMIN` and `errors.CANNOT_REMOVE_LAST_ADMIN` in
    `@endora-commerce/mod-customer-accounts`
  - `errors.CURRENCY_MISMATCH` in `@endora-commerce/mod-orders`

  The other four — `TWO_FACTOR_REQUIRED`, `TWO_FACTOR_REQUIRED_BY_ROLE`, `ALREADY_SUBSCRIBED` and
  `PROMOTION_INVALID` — are codes nothing in the platform raises, so there was no refusal to
  describe and the placeholder is deleted without a replacement. A consumer that reads those keys
  out of `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`'s bundle directly will no longer find them; nothing in the
  platform produced the codes they belonged to.

- b8bd8c7: `mfa` declares the ten error codes it owns.

  `manifest.ts` gains an `errorCodes` array — feature 090 Phase 3
  (`specs/090-module-owned-error-codes/`). Nothing the package exports changes
  shape. The observable difference for a consumer is that this module's error
  sentences are now routed by its own declaration rather than only by the prefix
  chain in `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`, which continues to answer identically for
  every one of them: the list is the chain's own answer, copied verbatim from the
  frozen capture, and is asserted equal to it in both directions.

  `TWO_FACTOR_REQUIRED` and `TWO_FACTOR_REQUIRED_BY_ROLE` are deliberately not
  among them. Both name this module's subject, neither carries the `MFA_` prefix,
  so both fall off the end of the chain to `core` — and the declaration follows
  the chain's answer rather than the noun.

  All ten already carry a written sentence in both `en` and `pl` in this package's
  own `i18n/` bundles, so no sentence moves and none is added. No `tokens`: none
  of the fourteen raise sites of these ten codes passes a fourth argument to
  `HttpError` at all, so there is no `details.code` for the envelope to read.

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.
