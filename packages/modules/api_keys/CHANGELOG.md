# @endora-commerce/mod-api-keys

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 0eeb9b5: Require Node >= 22.18.0.

  The previous floor was 22.17.0, which MikroORM 7 sets. 22.18.0 is the first release that
  strips TypeScript types without a flag, and that is what loads a deployment's overlay module:
  in a scaffolded instance `apps/` is outside every compiled member, so the unit the platform
  `import()`s is the client's own `.ts`. On 22.17.x that import throws
  `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` and the process dies before it listens. Emitting a `.js` beside
  the client's source was measured and refused — the overlay loader resolves `.js` before `.ts`
  while the divergence derivation admits both, so the sibling doubles every seam site in the
  report.

  Derived by probing 22.17.0, 22.17.1, 22.18.0 and 22.19.0 against a `.ts` module imported with
  no flag; 22.18.0 is the lowest that loads it.

  If you run 22.17.x, upgrade to 22.18 or later. Nothing else in these packages changed.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 6c8d958: Two tables are created by the packages that own them: `api_keys` and `customer_groups`
  (`specs/120-migration-closure-bridge-ownership/` Phase 3, FR-014 and the owner's ruling of
  2026-09-12).

  Both were created by whichever module needed them first rather than by the one that owns them. That
  is normally harmless — 27 such creations stay where they are, because a consumer who omits the
  creating module gets an empty table and nothing worse — and these two were not, because each also
  produced a reference from outside the referencing module's dependency closure: a fresh database
  could not be migrated by a member set that omitted the creator.

  **They move between two already-applied migration bodies, and that is the whole design.** The
  ordinary repair — take the statement out and re-add it in a new migration — is right for a
  _reference_, which can only move later in the computed order. It is wrong for a _creation_: a new
  migration runs after the entire frozen historical prefix, and both tables are referenced by
  migrations inside it, so the creation would have landed after its own consumers and broken a fresh
  database. Each creation therefore moves into the frozen body that carries the **earliest** reference
  to it, so no position in between is affected.

  **No class is renamed.** `mikro_orm_migrations` persists the class name and holds no checksum
  (measured on `@mikro-orm/migrations@6.6.13`), so neither edited body is re-offered to a database
  that has applied it, and nothing is pending anywhere from this change.

  **`create table if not exists`, and it is load-bearing rather than defensive.** A database that
  applied the _donating_ migration and has not yet reached the _receiving_ one — anything a release or
  more behind — already has the table while the receiving migration is pending. A verbatim creation
  fails there; the guarded one is a no-op. Both spellings were measured against a fully migrated
  database: guarded skips, unguarded raises `relation already exists`.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-api-keys`** — `Migration20260724T173916ApiKeysDistributorBinding` now creates
  `api_keys` and its `key_hash` index, above its own `alter table`, and drops the table in `down()`.
  Its position already preceded both frozen references — its own `alter`, and `orders`' foreign key.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-webhooks`** — `Migration20260425T091359WebhooksUs7Init` no longer creates
  `api_keys`. The two modules were one surface until the US7 split and the creation stayed behind;
  this package names `api_keys` in no statement of its own. A consumer installing `mod-webhooks`
  without `mod-api-keys` no longer receives the table, which is the point: it is not this package's.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-customer-accounts`** — `Migration20260611T140403CustomerAccountsLifecycle`
  now creates `customer_groups`, above the foreign key it already had to it, and drops the table in
  `down()`. This package's `CustomerGroup` entity has always owned the table.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-price-lists`** — `Migration20260426T075235PriceListsPricingInit` no longer
  creates `customer_groups`. Tiered pricing needed customer groups first and created them where it
  needed them; nothing in this package references the table — `price_list_assignments.customer_group_id`
  is a nullable column with an index and no foreign key.

### Patch Changes

- f20bc38: Documentation: these packages' pages no longer link Endora's own documentation
  site by relative path.

  A page each package ships under `docs/` linked `../architecture/…` or
  `../integrations/…` — a page above the modules category, which is site content
  and travels with no package. Installed anywhere but the Endora repository, the
  link named a page that is not there, and a documentation build over the
  installed set therefore failed under Docusaurus's `onBrokenLinks: 'throw'` —
  whatever else was installed alongside. The guides are now named in prose.

  No exported symbol, schema, route or translation key changes.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- e27bf6c: Every package that ships scannable UI now publishes its own Tailwind `@source`
  declarations at a new `./tailwind.css` subpath.

  A host compiling this package's utility classes no longer has to know where the
  package's sources are. Import the subpath from the stylesheet that builds your
  admin, and the package names its own layers:

  ```css
  @import 'tailwindcss';
  @import '@endora-commerce/mod-blog/tailwind.css';
  ```

  `@source` resolves relative to the stylesheet that declares it, so the paths hold
  wherever the package is installed. The file is generated from the package's layer
  inventory, ships in the tarball beside `package.json`, and its `dist` line is the one
  that matters to you — the `src` line beside it is inert in a published package and
  exists so that a checkout of this repository keeps scanning source in `dev`.

  **Nothing is removed or renamed**: every existing subpath resolves exactly as before.
  What is new is the obligation on the _host_ side, and it is a build error rather than a
  silent one. Before this, a host reached these packages with a glob over the monorepo
  (`@source "../../packages/**"`), which named a directory no installed tree has —
  and Tailwind reports nothing at all about a source that matches nothing, so such a host
  built green and rendered every screen unstyled. A host that now names a package that is
  not installed gets `Can't resolve`, and one whose tarball omits the file gets
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.

  `@endora-commerce/cms-components` deliberately does **not** publish this subpath. It
  ships a finished, prefixed stylesheet at `./styles.css` and must not also be scanned by
  its host.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- c94c52d: `api_keys`, `webhooks` and `comparisons` ship their admin surfaces, on a new `./admin` subpath
  each; `KnownIconNameSchema` gains two members and the kit's icon map the glyphs behind them.

  Each of the three module packages now exports `contributions` from
  `@endora-commerce/mod-<id>/admin` as an `AdminContributions` object whose every component is a
  dynamic-import factory, so a consumer's bundler emits one chunk per screen and none of it is
  downloaded by an operator who cannot reach it. The routes are unchanged — `/api-keys`,
  `/webhooks`, `/comparisons` and `/comparisons/:id` — and each package contributes a sidebar
  entry as well.

  Five things a consumer has to know:
  - **The subpath is a new `exports` entry, so it needs a build.** `./admin` resolves at
    `dist/admin/index.js`, emitted by each package's new `tsconfig.ui.json`. A checkout that has
    not run `pnpm run build:packages` cannot resolve it.
  - **`@endora-commerce/admin-kit`, `react` and `lucide-react` become peer dependencies of all
    three, and `react-router-dom` of `comparisons`.** They were backend-only packages before
    this. The kit is where every screen's design-system import now resolves, and React is peered
    rather than depended on so the application resolves one copy.
  - **Every route carries a `requiredPermission`, and the admin enforces it.**
    `integrations:manage` for `/api-keys` and `/webhooks`, `comparisons:read` for both comparison
    routes — in each case the code the screen's own API enforces. A host `<Route>` was ungated,
    so a consumer who deep-links one of these paths for an operator without the code now gets the
    admin's not-found treatment where the screen used to render and its API answered 403.
  - **`KnownIconNameSchema` gains `Webhook` and `Scale`.** A nav entry and a palette action name
    their icon; both glyphs were `lucide-react` imports inside the admin's own `AppShell.tsx`
    until this change, so keeping the sidebar looking the same meant adding the names rather than
    substituting two already on the allowlist. `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`'s `resolveIcon` maps
    both. Widening a `z.enum` is additive for a producer and narrowing for a consumer that
    exhaustively switches on `KnownIconName`; nothing in this repository does.
  - **Each of the three declares its first command-palette action** — `open-api-keys`,
    `open-webhooks` and `open-comparisons` — with both labels in the package's own `i18n/` bundle.
    A consumer resolving palette entries from the manifests will see one more per module.

  Nothing is removed and no existing export changes shape, so a consumer of any of the three
  `./backend`, `./migrations` or root subpaths is unaffected.

- 661e80d: Fourteen new packages: the **second** batch of modules to leave `backend/src/modules/`
  (feature 080, T040b). Five moved one at a time, then ten together; these fourteen are the
  same shape as the ten, and the properties below hold fourteen times over.

  **One changeset, not fourteen**, for the reason batch one gives: a changeset is written for
  the consumer of a package, and a package that did not exist a moment ago has no upgrader to
  instruct. What genuinely differs per package is its layer inventory, and that is the table.

  Every subpath is compiled output (D-164); none has a root wildcard; each package's `.` is
  its `manifest.ts`, where the generated manifest index reads the module's identity, its
  `dependencies`, its permission codes, its command-palette actions, its settings and its
  activation control.

  **`./backend` publishes `registerModule(ctx)` and an `entities` array, and no entity class by
  name** (D-168) — type-only exports included, which this batch measured rather than assumed:
  two packages published their entities' row types so the dev seed could name them, and
  `module-package-entity-surface.test.ts` refused both, in as many words — _"that is the one
  thing that makes a foreign module's `import type { … }` compile"_. The exports are gone and
  the seed takes each class off the published array by name.

  **One of the fourteen owns no table and says so with an empty array rather than by
  omission.** `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels` exports `entities: readonly never[] = []`.
  The distinction is not cosmetic: the platform's package loader answers a _missing_ export
  with `[]`, so "this module has no table" and "somebody forgot the array" would otherwise
  arrive as one silence, whose only symptom is a query against a table nobody created.

  **One package publishes a type on `./backend` that is not an entity**, and it is there
  because a composition root has to name a contribution it supplies:
  `@endora-commerce/mod-shopping-lists` re-exports `ShoppingListService`. A root cannot reach
  a package's internal file — `rootDir` makes a relative specifier into `packages/` TS6059
  even for an `import type` — so a contribution shape has to be on a published subpath or it
  is unnameable.

  **Two packages declare a `@fastify/*` dependency nothing imports.**
  `@endora-commerce/mod-mfa` peers on `@fastify/cookie` and `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa` on
  `@fastify/multipart`, because `reply.setCookie`, `request.isMultipart()` and
  `request.file()` are declaration-merging augmentations rather than imports. Inside the
  application those arrived ambiently through the host's own dependency; a package compiles
  against its own manifest, where an unnamed dependency does not exist. Both write
  `import type {} from '@fastify/…'`, which is type-only: the plugin is still the host's to
  register.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter` and `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa` also carry a companion
  `@types/*` in `devDependencies`** — `@types/nodemailer` and `@types/web-push` — which the
  manifest generator now derives. Nothing imports a `@types` package; the compiler finds it
  through `node_modules/@types`, which inside a package is the package's own declaration, so
  a module importing a JS-only library did not build until this landed.

### Patch Changes

- 3b07abc: Error-code ownership: Tier B's four remaining modules declare the codes they own, each shipping its
  first i18n bundle.

  `manifest.errorCodes` gains five codes on `@endora-commerce/mod-credit-limits`
  (`ACTIVE_RESERVATIONS_EXIST`, `ADJUSTMENT_BELOW_ACTIVE`, `CREDIT_LIMIT_ALREADY_GRANTED`,
  `CREDIT_LIMIT_NOT_GRANTED`, `LIMIT_INSUFFICIENT`), three on `@endora-commerce/mod-api-keys`
  (`API_KEY_CHANNEL_MISMATCH`, `API_KEY_NOT_BOUND`, `API_KEY_OUT_OF_SCOPE`), two on
  `@endora-commerce/mod-addresses` (`ADDRESS_IN_USE`, `ADDRESS_NOT_OWNED`) and one on
  `@endora-commerce/mod-webhooks` (`WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_NOT_REPLAYABLE`); `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`
  drops the same eleven from its own declaration, which is what decides where the error envelope
  looks for a sentence (D-129's remaining sweep, MR 5 of eight; D-121 tier T1 throughout; D-186 §2
  and §3 in `specs/080-f4-real-scope/rulings.md`;
  `specs/090-module-owned-error-codes/d129-sweep.md`).

  All four declare an error code for the first time, and all four gain an `i18n` bundle they never
  had, declared as `i18n: { bundlesDir: 'i18n' }` and shipped in `files`. No wire shape moves:
  `error.code` is unchanged for all eleven.

  **Nine sentences are deleted from `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`'s bundle, and this is
  operator-visible.** Each was the error code rewritten twice — `"Limit Insufficient."` in `en` and
  `"Błąd: limit insufficient."` in `pl` — which D-186 §2 refuses to carry into a module's own bundle,
  where it would read as that module's answer rather than as an unwritten sentence. Six of the nine
  are replaced by real prose in both languages in the receiving module's own bundle:
  - `errors.ADJUSTMENT_BELOW_ACTIVE`, `errors.CREDIT_LIMIT_ALREADY_GRANTED`,
    `errors.CREDIT_LIMIT_NOT_GRANTED` and `errors.LIMIT_INSUFFICIENT` in
    `@endora-commerce/mod-credit-limits`
  - `errors.ADDRESS_NOT_OWNED` in `@endora-commerce/mod-addresses`
  - `errors.WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_NOT_REPLAYABLE` in `@endora-commerce/mod-webhooks`

  The other three keep no sentence. `ACTIVE_RESERVATIONS_EXIST` and `ADDRESS_IN_USE` are raised by
  nothing in the platform, so there was no refusal to describe. `API_KEY_OUT_OF_SCOPE` is raised, and
  is still not rewritten: its reader is an integration rather than a person, and the raise names the
  scope the key is missing (`API key lacks the required scope: <scope>.`) — the envelope substitutes
  the message wholesale and that raise carries no `details`, so a fixed sentence would take
  information away from the only audience that meets it. A consumer that reads those three keys out
  of `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`'s bundle directly will no longer find them.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-api-keys` therefore ships a bundle that installs **zero** entries, which is a
  state no module in this platform has been in before. `loadModuleBundles` answers
  `{"byLanguage":{}}` for it and the boot reconciler counts it as installed.

  `API_KEY_CHANNEL_MISMATCH` is raised by the platform's sales-channel resolver and now takes its
  sentence from a switchable module's bundle (D-186 §3). The coupling is bounded: the raise needs an
  `api_key` actor, which only `@endora-commerce/mod-auth`'s request hook produces and only by calling
  `@endora-commerce/mod-api-keys`' gated `apiKeyResolver`, so with the module absent the code cannot
  be produced at all.

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.
