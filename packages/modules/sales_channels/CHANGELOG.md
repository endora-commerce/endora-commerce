# @endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- f11ccdb: `customers`, `organizations` and `sales_channels` ship their admin screens, and two icon names
  join the allowlist.

  **Three packages' `./admin` subpath gains `routes` and `nav`, and two of them gain the subpath
  itself.** `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels/admin` already exported `contributions` with a
  `zones` array and nothing else; it now declares its screens there too. `@endora-commerce/mod-customers`
  and `@endora-commerce/mod-organizations` had no `./admin` subpath at all and now declare one.
  Eight routes and six sidebar entries between them, at the paths and codes the hand-written host
  registrations carried. The exported symbol is the same one every other module package uses —
  `contributions`, an `AdminContributions` object, and nothing else — so a consumer already
  reading `sales_channels`' zones needs no edit.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-customers` — **new `./admin` subpath**, exporting `contributions`.
    `/customers` (the landing route), `/customers/online` and `/customers/:id`, all on
    `customers:read`, which is the code every `GET` behind them enforces; the detail screen keeps
    gating its block, unblock, impersonate, delete and restore controls on `customers:manage`
    inside itself. Two sidebar rows, in the `customers` section at weights 100 and 200. The detail
    screen is reached from the roster and has no row of its own. `CustomerDetail` renders the
    `customer.detail.after` zone, which is unchanged.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-organizations` — **new `./admin` subpath**, exporting `contributions`.
    `/organizations` and `/organizations/:id`, both on the **any-of pair**
    `['customers:read', 'customers:manage']`, which is what
    `requireAdminAny(['customers:read', 'customers:manage'])` enforces on every organization
    endpoint. `AdminNavDeclaration.requiredPermission` and `AdminRouteDeclaration.requiredPermission`
    both take a `PermissionRequirement`, so the pair is declared rather than collapsed: naming only
    the read code hides the screen from a role holding just `customers:manage`. One sidebar row, in
    the `customers` section at weight 300. `OrganizationDetail` renders the
    `organization.detail.after` zone — four modules contribute there — and that is unchanged.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels` — `/sales-channels` and `/sales-channels/:code` on
    `sales_channels:read`, and `/sales-channels/new` on `sales_channels:write`. **That last one is a
    behaviour change for a consumer rendering these routes**: the create form is a screen whose only
    purpose is a write, `POST /api/v1/admin/sales-channels` enforces `sales_channels:write`, and the
    module's own `new-sales-channel` palette action already advertised that code. It was ungated
    while the route was the admin application's, so an operator holding only `sales_channels:read`
    could open a form whose save then refused; the roster's _+ New channel_ button is gated on the
    same code in this release, so the dead end is closed at both ends. `credentials` ships the
    identical split for `/credentials/new`. One sidebar row, in the `channels` section at weight 100.
    `SalesChannelEditPage` renders the `sales_channel.editor.after` zone, which is unchanged.

  **`@endora-commerce/contracts` — two members join `KnownIconNameSchema`: `Building2` and
  `Store`.** They are the glyphs the admin application drew for `/organizations` and
  `/sales-channels` by hand. A contribution names its icon rather than importing it, so a name that
  is not on the allowlist degrades to the fallback; adding them is what keeps the two rows looking
  as they did. Widening an enum is additive for a consumer validating against it and breaking for
  one exhaustively switching over `KnownIconName` — there is no such consumer in this repository.

  **`@endora-commerce/admin-kit` — `resolveIcon` answers for both new names.** `ICON_MAP` gains
  `Building2` and `Store`; the function's signature is unchanged and every existing name resolves
  exactly as before.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-customers`, `@endora-commerce/mod-organizations` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels` ship new i18n keys, and `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n` loses
  six.** `nav.customers.label`, `nav.customersOnline.label`, `nav.organizations.label`,
  `nav.salesChannels.label` and the two new actions' `label`/`description` pairs are in the three
  modules' own `i18n/{en,pl}.json`; `appShell.nav.customers`, `appShell.nav.customersOnline`,
  `appShell.nav.organizations`, `appShell.nav.salesChannels`,
  `appShell.palette.sub.customerAccounts` and `appShell.palette.sub.storefrontChannels` are removed
  from the shared bundle in both shipped languages, nothing rendering them any more. **A consumer
  resolving one of those six keys out of the `core` namespace will get a raw key**; each has a
  module-namespaced replacement above.

  **`organizations` and `sales_channels` declare a new palette action each.**
  `open-organizations` (`/organizations`, `customers:read`) and `open-sales-channels`
  (`/sales-channels`, `sales_channels:read`) replace hand-written rows in the admin's own palette
  table — copies the server was never asked about, which went on advertising the screens whatever
  the effective enabled-set said. One narrowing comes with `open-organizations`:
  `ModuleActionSchema.requiredPermission` is a single string, so it names `customers:read` and a
  role holding only `customers:manage` loses the palette entry while keeping the sidebar one.

- 1ba52e1: `sales_channels.theme_code` is read. It had not been, since 2026-04-30.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels`** registers `GET
/api/v1/storefront/sales-channel`, the public read `PublicSalesChannelSchema`
  has described since feature `005-sales-channels` and that no route implemented.
  It answers `{ data: PublicSalesChannel }` for the channel the resolver picked
  for the request — code, display name, language and currency scopes, `themeCode`,
  `logoUrl` — and drops `id`, `active`, `systemDefault` and `version`. The channel
  comes from `getResolvedChannel()`, so the endpoint re-resolves nothing and
  writes no query of its own. `logoUrl` is `null`, as it is on the admin detail
  shape; resolving an asset id to a URL is a separate change.

  **`@endora-commerce/contracts`** adds, to `sales-channels.ts`:
  - `PublicSalesChannelResponseSchema` / `PublicSalesChannelResponse` — the
    envelope of the route above.
  - `STOREFRONT_THEME_CODES`, `StorefrontThemeCodeSchema`, `StorefrontThemeCode`,
    `DEFAULT_STOREFRONT_THEME_CODE` and `isStorefrontThemeCode` — the storefront
    themes that exist (`industria`, `nordic`). The admin's channel form renders a
    list from this instead of a free-text box, because a free-text box could store
    a code nothing implements, which is what it had been doing.

  Nothing is removed and no existing shape changes. **`SalesChannelCreateBodySchema`
  and `SalesChannelEditBodySchema` still validate `themeCode` against the
  `^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*$` regex and not against the new enum**, deliberately: a
  deployment that forks the storefront owns its own theme codes, and a backend that
  refused them would make the field unusable for exactly those deployments. A code
  this storefront does not implement renders in the default theme and is reported
  in the storefront's log; it is never guessed at and never silently rewritten.

- eeb6a47: Four zone members for the category editor, the product editor and the sales-channel editor.

  `@endora-commerce/contracts` adds four members to `AdminZoneNameSchema`, each with its
  entry in `AdminZonePropsMap`:

  | Member                         | Props                                       | Rendered by                                           |
  | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
  | `category.editor.after`        | `CategoryEditorZoneProps { categoryId }`    | the category editor's form, after its save/cancel row |
  | `product.editor.pricing.after` | `ProductEditorZoneProps` (reused)           | the end of the product editor's Pricing tab           |
  | `product.editor.channels`      | `ProductEditorZoneProps` (reused)           | the body of the product editor's Channels tab         |
  | `sales_channel.editor.after`   | `SalesChannelEditorZoneProps { channelId }` | below the sales-channel editor's identity form        |

  `CategoryEditorZoneProps` and `SalesChannelEditorZoneProps` are new exported interfaces.
  `ProductEditorZoneProps` is reused for the two product members rather than aliased: a props
  type is the shape the mount carries, and two places in one editor that both carry a product
  id carry the same shape.

  ```tsx
  import { AdminZone, useAdminZone } from '@endora-commerce/admin-kit/zones';

  // A tab whose body is a zone shows its button by counting the zone, never by
  // naming the module that fills it.
  const contributions = useAdminZone('product.editor.channels', { productId });
  // …
  <AdminZone name="product.editor.channels" props={{ productId }} />;
  ```

  `@endora-commerce/mod-price-lists` gains an `./admin` subpath declaring two zone
  contributions — `category.editor.after` and `product.editor.pricing.after`, both at
  `price_lists:read` — and takes `DisplayModeOverrideRow` and `LinkedPriceListsPanel` with it.

  **`DisplayModeOverrideRow` loses its `label` and `inheritHint` props**, and that is a copy
  change an operator will see. A host cannot hand its own wording to a contributor it does not
  know, so the control renders `priceLists.displayMode.rowLabel` in every place it appears.
  Two screens read different words than before: the category editor, which passed `catalog`'s
  `categories.priceDisplayMode.label` / `.help` (both keys are removed from `catalog`'s
  bundle — hence its `patch`), and the product editor's Pricing tab, which passed this
  module's own `priceLists.linked.displayModeLabel` / `.displayModeHint`. Those two `core`
  keys are now read by nothing; they are left in place because the same props are still passed
  by `organizations`' detail screen, whose conversion is a separate merge request.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels` gains an `./admin` subpath declaring one contribution,
  `product.editor.channels` at `sales_channels:read`, and takes `EntityChannelMembership` with
  it. Its four calls are rebuilt from the published `apiClient` rather than moving
  `sales-channels-client`, so the package reaches nothing in the admin application.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-inventory` gains an `./admin` subpath declaring one contribution,
  `sales_channel.editor.after` at `inventory:read`, and takes the panel formerly at
  `admin/src/modules/warehouses/ChannelMembershipPanel.tsx`. Its own
  `isVisible({ module: 'inventory', requiredPermission: 'inventory:read' })` gate is gone —
  the zone renderer applies presence and that code before the chunk is fetched — while the
  `inventory:write` half stays, because a contribution declares one code and the panel offers
  a read view and write actions behind two.

  No contribution declares a `match`: each names a member exactly one host mounts, and `match`
  narrows the mounts of one place.

- 661e80d: Fourteen new packages: the **second** batch of modules to leave `backend/src/modules/`
  (feature 080, T040b). Five moved one at a time, then ten together; these fourteen are the
  same shape as the ten, and the properties below hold fourteen times over.

  **One changeset, not fourteen**, for the reason batch one gives: a changeset is written for
  the consumer of a package, and a package that did not exist a moment ago has no upgrader to
  instruct. What genuinely differs per package is its layer inventory, and that is the table.

  Every subpath is compiled output (D-164); none has a root wildcard; each package's `.` is
  its `manifest.ts`, where the generated manifest index reads the module's identity, its
  `dependencies`, its permission codes, its command-palette actions, its settings and its
  activation control.

  | Package                                     | Subpaths                         | Entities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Migrations | Ships          |

  **`./backend` publishes `registerModule(ctx)` and an `entities` array, and no entity class by
  name** (D-168) — type-only exports included, which this batch measured rather than assumed:
  two packages published their entities' row types so the dev seed could name them, and
  `module-package-entity-surface.test.ts` refused both, in as many words — _"that is the one
  thing that makes a foreign module's `import type { … }` compile"_. The exports are gone and
  the seed takes each class off the published array by name.

  **One of the fourteen owns no table and says so with an empty array rather than by
  omission.** `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels` exports `entities: readonly never[] = []`.
  The distinction is not cosmetic: the platform's package loader answers a _missing_ export
  with `[]`, so "this module has no table" and "somebody forgot the array" would otherwise
  arrive as one silence, whose only symptom is a query against a table nobody created.

  **One package publishes a type on `./backend` that is not an entity**, and it is there
  because a composition root has to name a contribution it supplies:
  `@endora-commerce/mod-shopping-lists` re-exports `ShoppingListService`. A root cannot reach
  a package's internal file — `rootDir` makes a relative specifier into `packages/` TS6059
  even for an `import type` — so a contribution shape has to be on a published subpath or it
  is unnameable.

  **Two packages declare a `@fastify/*` dependency nothing imports.**
  `@endora-commerce/mod-mfa` peers on `@fastify/cookie` and `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa` on
  `@fastify/multipart`, because `reply.setCookie`, `request.isMultipart()` and
  `request.file()` are declaration-merging augmentations rather than imports. Inside the
  application those arrived ambiently through the host's own dependency; a package compiles
  against its own manifest, where an unnamed dependency does not exist. Both write
  `import type {} from '@fastify/…'`, which is type-only: the plugin is still the host's to
  register.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter` and `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa` also carry a companion
  `@types/*` in `devDependencies`** — `@types/nodemailer` and `@types/web-push` — which the
  manifest generator now derives. Nothing imports a `@types` package; the compiler finds it
  through `node_modules/@types`, which inside a package is the package's own declaration, so
  a module importing a JS-only library did not build until this landed.

- 184fa9f: Two detail-screen zone members, four contributors, and the end of two live component
  duplications.

  `@endora-commerce/contracts` adds two members to `AdminZoneNameSchema`, each with its entry
  in `AdminZonePropsMap`:

  | Member                      | Props                                            | Rendered by                                         |
  | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
  | `organization.detail.after` | `OrganizationDetailZoneProps { organizationId }` | the end of the organization detail screen, **once** |
  | `customer.detail.after`     | `CustomerDetailZoneProps { customerId }`         | the end of the customer detail screen, **once**     |

  `OrganizationDetailZoneProps` and `CustomerDetailZoneProps` are new exported interfaces. The
  second is not an alias of the first: the prop is named for the entity the mount carries, and
  the two members are two places.

  **One mount per screen is a rule, not a layout choice.** Neither member carries a prop that
  could tell two mounts apart, so a second mount of either renders every contribution twice
  and nothing in the renderer can distinguish them.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-quick-order` gains an `./admin` subpath — its first — with two zone
  contributions and `DefaultPreferencesPanel`, which moves into the package. The panel's two
  preference calls are rebuilt from the published `apiClient`; `quick-order-client.ts` stays in
  the admin application, where the on-behalf-of screen still uses it.

  ```tsx
  // Both contributions declare `orders:write`, which is the code every admin
  // route this module owns enforces. There is no `quick_order:*` permission.
  zoneComponent('organization.detail.after', () => import('./zones/OrganizationDefaults.js'), {
    weight: 300,
    requiredPermission: 'orders:write',
  });
  ```

  `@endora-commerce/mod-carts` gains its first zone contribution and a new route,
  `GET /api/v1/admin/organizations/:id/cart-approval-policy`, gated on `customers:manage` and
  answering `cartApprovalPolicyResponseSchema` — the same code and the same shape as the
  `PATCH` that has been there since feature 027. `CartApprovalService` gains `getPolicyByAdmin`.
  The contribution reads its own initial state through that route instead of taking the
  `initialRequiresCartApproval` prop the old panel took, because a zone's props cannot carry a
  value only one of four contributors wants.

  That panel had been imported by nothing, and the copy it rendered was in no bundle under any
  spelling — `t('carts.policy.title')` under the `carts` namespace resolves to
  `bundle['carts']['carts.policy.title']`, which never existed. Ten `policy.*` keys are added to
  this package's own bundle in both shipped languages, and the capability reaches an operator
  for the first time.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-price-lists` and `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels` each gain a
  second contribution over a component they already ship, and each loses its duplicate:
  `DisplayModeOverrideRow` and `EntityChannelMembership` existed twice in the tree for the
  length of the previous release, because the organization detail screen still imported the
  `admin/src` copy. Both copies are gone and nothing imports them.

  **Operator-visible copy change.** The organization detail's pricing card is now
  `price_lists`' own: the screen used to pass `organizations.detail.pricingLabel` and
  `organizations.detail.pricingHint` into a control it does not own and wrap it in a card
  titled `organizations.detail.pricingCard`. A host cannot hand copy to a contributor it does
  not know, so the control renders `priceLists.displayMode.rowLabel` and its own hint, and all
  three host keys are removed from the `core` bundle in both languages. Two further `core` keys
  go with them — `priceLists.linked.displayModeLabel` and `priceLists.linked.displayModeHint`,
  which the previous release left unread.

  No contribution declares a `match`, and each says why in its own file: `match` narrows the
  mounts of one place, and each of these members has one host and one mount. Every zone test
  asserts it absent.

### Patch Changes

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.

- 54587bf: `sales_channels` declares the twelve error codes it owns.

  `manifest.ts` gains an `errorCodes` array — feature 090 Phase 3
  (`specs/090-module-owned-error-codes/`). Nothing the package exports changes
  shape. The observable difference for a consumer is that this module's error
  sentences are now routed by its own declaration rather than only by the prefix
  chain in `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`, which continues to answer identically for
  every one of them: the list is the chain's own answer, copied verbatim from the
  frozen capture, and is asserted equal to it in both directions.

  `UNKNOWN_OPTION` is deliberately not among them. This module's rule in the chain
  is the `UNKNOWN_` prefix, but `catalog` claims that code two branches earlier, so
  the chain's answer is `catalog` and the declaration follows the answer.

  All twelve already carry a written sentence in both `en` and `pl` in this
  package's own `i18n/` bundles, so no sentence moves and none is added. No
  `tokens`: no raise site of any of the twelve passes a `details.code`
  discriminator.
