# @endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels

## 0.109.0

### Minor Changes

- 61fc321: The storefront language is part of the URL path (`/pl/p/wiertarka`, `/en/p/drill`, issue #396).

  **Upgrade note for operators: existing sales channels keep their addresses.** The migration
  `Migration20261029T152922CoreSalesChannelsPrefixDefaultLanguage` adds the per-channel setting
  _Prefix the default language in URLs_ and switches it **off** on every channel that exists when it
  runs, so default-language URLs stay unprefixed; channels created later start **on**. To adopt
  prefixes for the default language too, switch _Prefix the default language in URLs_ on in
  _Sales channels_ → the channel. Other languages are prefixed either way: a former
  `/p/<key>?lang=<L>` link answers a permanent redirect to `/<prefix>/p/<key>`. A CMS page whose slug
  starts with a channel language prefix can no longer be saved.

  `@endora-commerce/contracts`:

  - New: `channelUrlLanguages`, `channelUrlLanguageAliases`, `storefrontPagePath`,
    `storefrontPagePathFor`, `storefrontDefaultPath`, `channelUrlLanguageSchema`,
    `channelUrlLanguageAliasSchema`, `URL_LANGUAGE_PREFIX_PATTERN`, types `ChannelUrlFacts`,
    `ChannelUrlLanguage`, `ChannelUrlLanguageAlias`; `productDefaultPath(key)`.
  - **`productPath` takes the channel's URL facts and never appends `?lang=`:**
    `productPath({ key, languageCode, channelDefaultLanguage })` (`/p/drill?lang=en-US`) becomes
    `productPath({ key, languageCode, channel })` (`/en/p/drill`), where `channel` is any
    `{ languages, defaultLanguage, prefixDefaultLanguage }` — the cached channel satisfies it.
  - `productKeyResolutionSchema`'s `redirect` requires `permanent` (`false` for a key of another
    channel language, answered 307); `productPagePathsSchema` requires `xDefault`.
  - Sales channel shapes carry `prefixDefaultLanguage` (create defaults to `true`); the public
    channel read answers `prefixDefaultLanguage`, `urlLanguages` and `urlLanguageAliases`.
  - `cmsPageUrl` (163 R24) takes the channel's URL facts and composes the prefixed path:
    `cmsPageUrl({ path, languageCode, channelDefaultLanguage })` (`/about-us?lang=en-US`) becomes
    `cmsPageUrl({ path, languageCode, channel })` (`/en/about-us`). The resolved CMS page's `url` and
    `alternates`, and the storefront page index, therefore carry each language's own slug under its
    prefix.
  - `CmsPageRecord` gains optional `languages` and `translations` (the `seo` sitemap lists each
    language at its own slug); `cmsPageSummarySchema` gains an optional
    `shadowedByLanguagePrefix` (any of the page's slugs, per-language ones included).

  Emitters (catalog, seo sitemap, product feeds, organizations, customers, newsletter, comparisons,
  mfa, invoices) compose prefixed storefront URLs; the product feed `link` uses the product's key in
  the feed language; the invoice e-mail links the storefront order page; the admin password reset
  links `/password-reset/confirm`. `cms-components` localizes block links through the render
  context's `localizePath`.

- e68dad1: A sales channel's identity writes — `SalesChannelsService.create` and `SalesChannelsService.update`, behind `POST` and `PATCH /api/v1/admin/sales-channels` — now run as Commands through `CommandBus.run` (Principle XIII), as `setDefault` already did.

  - **They need an ambient TenantContext.** The Command Bus refuses a write with none (`MissingTenantContextError`), so code that calls the service outside a request — a worker, a CLI step, an install hook — must wrap the call, for example in `withSystemScope('<reason>', () => service.update(...))` from `@endora-commerce/platform/tenancy`. Admin HTTP requests already carry one.
  - **The optional second `context` argument of `create` and the fourth of `update` are gone.** The actor and the request id come from the TenantContext; drop the argument.
  - **The audit row keeps its action, `sales_channel.identity.changed`, and changes shape.** `stateBefore` holds the channel's snapshot before the write (`null` on create), and `stateAfter` holds the snapshot after it. Previously, `stateAfter` was `{ action: 'created' | 'updated', before?, after }` and `stateBefore` was empty. The row is now written in the same transaction as the write, so a failed write leaves no row.
  - The channel cache is still dropped after the write has committed and before `sales_channels.identity_changed` is emitted (D-93), so subscribers read the new state.
  - The _Open to anonymous visitors_ hint, and the admin guide's matching note, no longer refer to a price-visibility setting the admin does not have.

### Patch Changes

- bec2e83: Polish error messages are Polish sentences. 137 `errors.*` entries in these modules' `i18n/pl.json`
  bundles were placeholders — the word "Błąd:" followed by the error code lowercased, for example
  "Błąd: product not found." — and a request with `Accept-Language: pl` received them verbatim as
  `error.message`. Each is now a sentence in Polish, for example "Nie znaleziono produktu."

  Error codes, HTTP statuses and the English sentences are unchanged; a client matching on the code
  sees no difference.

- 1a88646: English error messages are English sentences. 137 `errors.*` entries in these modules'
  `i18n/en.json` bundles were the error code in Title Case with a full stop, for example
  "Product Not Found." or "Asset Legacy Locator Cannot Harden.", and a request in English received
  them verbatim as `error.message`. Each is now a sentence in sentence case, for example
  "Product not found." or "This file cannot be made private because it is stored at an address the
  platform did not issue. Upload it again first."

  Two Polish sentences were corrected to match what the code refuses: `CANNOT_MODIFY_SYSTEM_DEFAULT`
  (`mod-sales-channels`) now says the default sales channel can be neither deactivated nor deleted,
  and `MEGAMENU_TARGET_OUT_OF_SCOPE` (`mod-megamenu`) now names a page as well as a category.

  Error codes and HTTP statuses are unchanged; a client matching on the code sees no difference. A
  client that matched on the English message text must match the new sentences.

- f261ed3: The sales channel's `isPublic` flag is retired in favour of the pricing display-mode chain
  (issue #492; closes #467). The flag was documented as anonymous-price visibility, but every read of
  it withheld prices from **everyone** on the channel, signed-in buyers included, beside a chain that
  already says "prices after sign-in" per channel: `pricing.unauthenticated_display_mode = none`.

  **Behaviour change.** Signed-in buyers on a channel that had `isPublic = false` now see prices
  according to the display-mode chain (their organization's override, else the channel's
  `pricing.default_display_mode`), where they used to see none — on the catalogue listing, the product
  page, product links, search, comparisons, and the price sort and range, which are no longer refused
  to them. Anonymous visitors on such a channel still see no prices: the migration below carries that
  half of the flag over. A channel that had `isPublic = false` **and** its own value for
  `pricing.unauthenticated_display_mode` keeps that value, so its anonymous visitors now see prices if
  that value is a priced mode. A new channel, the boot-time default channel included, no longer starts
  with prices hidden from everyone; it follows the chain like any other.

  The display-mode chain itself is unchanged (owner ruling of 2026-10-28): a product or category
  override takes precedence over the channel's `pricing.unauthenticated_display_mode`, also for
  anonymous visitors, so a product overridden to `gross_only` shows its price to guests on a channel
  whose guest mode is `none`. An organization override still applies to signed-in buyers only.

  - **`@endora-commerce/platform`.** New migration `Migration20261028T173317CoreSalesChannelsRetireIsPublic`
    (core): every channel with `is_public = false` and no value of its own for
    `pricing.unauthenticated_display_mode` gets `"none"` as its per-channel value, then
    `sales_channels.is_public` is dropped. It refuses — rather than migrating into showing prices — a
    database that has a non-public channel but no registered `pricing.unauthenticated_display_mode`
    setting; start the platform once on the previous release, so the settings reconciler registers
    it, and migrate again. Because the column is dropped, stop processes running the previous release
    before migrating. `SalesChannel.isPublic` and `CachedChannel.isPublic` are removed;
    `SALES_CHANNELS_CACHE_KEY_PREFIX` moves from `sales-channels:v3:` to `sales-channels:v4:`, so no
    process reads an entry cached in the other shape. The default-channel reconciler no longer sets
    the flag.
  - **`@endora-commerce/contracts`.** `ResolvedSearchChannel.isPublic` is removed — drop it from the
    context you hand `SearchQueryPort`. No public HTTP shape carried the flag, so no response changes
    shape. The `SALES_CHANNEL_AUDIT_ACTIONS` documentation now says who writes each row: the identity
    Commands (with `stateBefore` / `stateAfter` snapshots) since #484.
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-catalog`.** `CatalogResolvedChannel.isPublic` and the `isPublic` field of
    `ProductLinkService`'s storefront context are removed. The catalogue no longer skips pricing on
    a channel: prices follow the viewer's display mode (a viewer whose mode is `none` gets the
    withheld answer, `resolvedPrice.displayMode: 'none'`, where the channel used to answer
    `resolvedPrice: null`). The price controls are refused only where the page's display mode is
    `none`; the reason "This sales channel does not publish prices…" is gone.
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-search`.** The service's `ResolvedSearchChannel.isPublic` is removed, and
    hits are always resolved for the viewer.
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-comparisons`.** A comparison is priced for the viewer on every channel.
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels`.** The channel form's _Open to anonymous visitors_ hint
    gains a second line pointing to the guest display mode, with a link to _Pricing settings_
    (`identity.anonymousAccess.pricesHint`, `identity.anonymousAccess.pricesLink`, English and
    Polish). New channels are no longer written with the flag.
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-price-lists`, `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`.** _Pricing settings_ states,
    under the two default modes, that a channel's own value wins over them and that a product or
    category override takes precedence over both, for anonymous visitors too
    (`priceLists.displayModes.settings.precedenceHint`).
  - **`@endora-commerce/demo-composition`.** The `pl_b2b_vip` channel is created without the flag and
    a new step, _the VIP channel hides prices until sign-in_, sets its
    `pricing.unauthenticated_display_mode` to `none`; its signed-in buyers see prices. `pl_retail`
    publishes prices to everyone, as before.
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-settings`, `@endora-commerce/cli`.** Comments only: the cache-clear
    namespace names the new key prefix, and the channel-resolution rule no longer cites the flag.

- c99b4cd: The command-palette actions of the commerce modules (`carts`, `catalog`, `comparisons`, `credit_limits`, `customer_accounts`, `customers`, `custom_fields`, `delivery_methods`, `dictionaries`, `document_templates`, `import_export`, `inventory`, `invoice_ledger`, `invoices`, `payment_methods`, `price_lists`, `product_feeds`, `promotions`, `quote_requests`, `sales_channels`, `taxes`) keep only English `keywords` in their manifests. Their Polish search words moved to each module's `i18n/pl.json` under the action's new `keywordsKey`, with an English entry in `i18n/en.json` (issue #573, following #560), and the ones that had been written without diacritics now carry them (`utwórz cennik`, `wyjaśnienie ceny`, `kolejność cen`). A Polish operator finds the same screens by the same words; an English-language admin is no longer offered the Polish ones.
- 6e8d6d0: The ⌘K command palette now matches a query word by word: every word typed must occur somewhere in the row — its label, description or any keyword — instead of the whole query having to appear, contiguously, in one of them. A single-word query matches exactly what it matched before; matching stays case- and diacritic-insensitive.

  Before this, `kanał sprzedaży` did not find the `Kanały sprzedaży` screen, and `sales channels` did not find it in a Polish-language admin, because each word lived in a different field. The rule is the same for the Actions, Navigate and Assistant groups.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels` adds the keyword `kanały` to its `open-sales-channels` palette action, so an English-language admin finds the screen by its Polish name too. The new keyword reaches the palette on the next boot, which reconciles `module_actions` from the manifest.

## 0.107.0

### Minor Changes

- 248a9df: Channels carry _open to anonymous visitors_ (`anonymousAccess`) on the admin list, detail, create
  (default open) and update, audited and versioned like every identity field.
  `GET /api/v1/storefront/sales-channel` returns it and stays reachable on a closed channel. New
  `GET /api/v1/storefront/sales-channel/access` tells the viewer whether it may use the store and,
  for a refused customer, which active stores its Organization may use (with each store's
  `sales_channels.storefront_url`); it is `private, no-store` and never refuses. The module declares
  the `SALES_CHANNEL_SIGN_IN_REQUIRED` and `SALES_CHANNEL_NOT_PERMITTED` codes with English and
  Polish sentences. Deleting a channel drops the access cache.
- afaa86a: The channel form has an _Open to anonymous visitors_ control (on for a new channel) that saves
  `anonymousAccess`, and the channel roster marks a channel closed to anonymous visitors with a
  _Sign-in required_ badge. The `organization.detail.after` zone contribution is withdrawn: an
  Organization's channels are edited in the `organizations` module's own _Sales channels_ panel.

### Patch Changes

- 649fe8d: Documentation for sales-channel access (`specs/154-sales-channel-access/`), shipped in each
  package's `docs/` directory, English and Polish.

  - `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels`: the access rule (anonymous visitors only on channels open
    to them, customers only on channels assigned to their Organization), the _Open to anonymous
    visitors_ option, `GET /api/v1/storefront/sales-channel/access`, and a corrected multi-storefront
    section. The developer guide tells module authors to declare
    `config: { salesChannelAccess: 'open' }` on every provider callback their module receives
    (payment gateway notifications, carrier webhooks, provider return URLs) — such requests arrive
    without a session and are refused on a store closed to anonymous visitors otherwise — and
    describes `SalesChannelAccessPort`.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-organizations`: the _Sales channels_ panel, the _New organization_ screen,
    which channel a new Organization gets, and that invitations change no channel.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-carts`: one basket per store, and the `ORDER_SALES_CHANNEL_MISMATCH`
    refusal at order placement.

## 0.104.0

### Patch Changes

- 1a15fdc: The Sales Channel create and edit forms pick languages and currencies from searchable controls,
  and a default that is no longer selected is reported instead of being replaced.

  - **`@endora-commerce/admin-kit/ui` exports `MultiCombobox`** (with `MultiComboboxProps`) — a
    searchable multi-select: one combobox input over a filtered listbox, the selection shown as
    removable chips. It takes the same `ComboboxOption[]` as `Combobox` and a `value: T[]` /
    `onChange(next: T[])` pair, matches on `label` and `description` without regard to diacritics,
    and is driven from the keyboard (arrows, `Home`/`End`, `Enter` to toggle, `Escape`, `Backspace`
    to remove the last chip). `MultiSelect` is unchanged and remains the control for filter bars.
  - **`Combobox` accepts `invalid` and `ariaDescribedBy`**, so it can be used as a validated form
    field, and **closes its listbox when focus leaves it**. It used to stay open after `Tab`, until a
    pointer press elsewhere; a caller that relied on that has nothing to change, the list simply no
    longer covers the next field.
  - **Sales Channel form**: _Languages_ and _Currencies_ are `MultiCombobox`es over the active
    Dictionary entries, searchable by code and by name; _Default language_ and _Default currency_ are
    `Combobox`es limited to what is selected. Removing the entry that is the current default now
    **empties the default** and blocks saving until one is chosen — the form used to promote the
    first remaining entry silently. The submitted value has the same shape as before.
  - The shared admin bundle gains `common.multiCombobox.added`, `.noMatches`, `.remove` and
    `.removed` in English and Polish.

## 0.102.0

### Patch Changes

- 489a0b6: Documentation: the developer guide now imports from the published platform barrel —
  `getResolvedChannel` and `currentSalesChannel` from `@endora-commerce/platform/kernel` — instead
  of a relative path into platform internals that no module can resolve. It also corrects three
  other statements: the resolved channel lives on the request's platform scope, not on
  `req.salesChannel`; outside a request a module resolves `salesChannelResolutionPort` /
  `salesChannelMembershipPort` rather than the unpublished service classes; and direct writes to
  `sales_channel_*` bridge tables are caught by `check:module-boundary`, not by a lint rule.

## 0.101.1

### Patch Changes

- 69a3717: The `fastify` peer is now `^5.11.0` instead of `^5`, so an install can no longer resolve Fastify 5.0–5.10. On those versions an async route handler that calls `reply.send()` without `return` throws `ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT` as an uncaught exception from Fastify's onSend hook runner, and the process crash-loops; Fastify 5.11.0 catches that error and the server keeps running. An instance scaffolded by `endora new instance` now declares `fastify@^5.11.0` as well. Nothing to do on upgrade unless your project pins Fastify below 5.11 — move it to `^5.11.0` (the repository itself runs 5.12.5).

  declares or depends on changes. `@endora-commerce/contracts` and

  `CHANGELOG.md` entry, with no change to what that entry says about the code.

### Patch Changes

- 8f61a6b: Every published package now ships its own `LICENSE` and `README.md`.

  npm force-includes a file named `LICENSE` into the tarball exactly as it does `README.md`,
  whatever `files` says, so the text has to be in the package directory and not only at the
  repository root — `LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md` states that rule and, until this release, no package
  obeyed it. Measured on `master`: **0** of the 82 publishable packages carried a `LICENSE` and
  **14** carried a `README.md`, so every tarball shipped without licence text and 68 registry
  pages would have rendered empty.

  Both files are **generated**, by `pnpm --filter backend run manifests:generate`, and refused
  when stale by `manifests:check` in the `quality` job:
  - the `LICENSE` is the repository's root `LICENSE`, copied verbatim — the same single source
    the `license: MIT` field is already rendered from. A package that declares a licence of its
    own in the `SEE LICENSE IN <file>` form is skipped and keeps the file it names.
  - the `README.md` is rendered from what the package's own manifest declares: its description,
    its module id where it has one, every published subpath with what that layer holds, its peer
    dependencies with the optional ones marked, the locales its `i18n/` carries and what the
    tarball ships. A `README.md` **without** the generated marker on its first line is a human's
    and is never rewritten — the fourteen that existed are untouched.

  Five module packages also get their npm description back. `@endora-commerce/mod-blog`,
  `mod-credit-limits`, `mod-dhl-parcel`, `mod-google-analytics` and `mod-quote-requests` carried
  the note written when they were moved out of `backend/src/modules` — _"the first module to
  leave backend/src/modules … the manifest id stays identity of record"_ — as the sentence a
  registry shows under the package name. Each now carries the sentence its own module manifest
  declares, which is where `descriptionFor` seeds one from in the first place.

  No API changes, no new dependency, no behaviour change: what moves is what the tarball carries
  and what a package page says.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 0eeb9b5: Require Node >= 22.18.0.

  The previous floor was 22.17.0, which MikroORM 7 sets. 22.18.0 is the first release that
  strips TypeScript types without a flag, and that is what loads a deployment's overlay module:
  in a scaffolded instance `apps/` is outside every compiled member, so the unit the platform
  `import()`s is the client's own `.ts`. On 22.17.x that import throws
  `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` and the process dies before it listens. Emitting a `.js` beside
  the client's source was measured and refused — the overlay loader resolves `.js` before `.ts`
  while the divergence derivation admits both, so the sibling doubles every seam site in the
  report.

  Derived by probing 22.17.0, 22.17.1, 22.18.0 and 22.19.0 against a `.ts` module imported with
  no flag; 22.18.0 is the lowest that loads it.

  If you run 22.17.x, upgrade to 22.18 or later. Nothing else in these packages changed.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- bd596a9: The sales-channel bridge tables are declared by the modules that own them, not by the platform.

  **`@endora-commerce/platform`** — `SalesChannelMembershipService` no longer holds a map total over
  `ChannelMemberEntityTypeSchema`. It resolves `{ table, entityIdColumn }` through a new
  `ChannelBridgeRegistry`, which each owning module fills at compose time, and a composition root
  contributes as the container name `salesChannelBridgeRegistry`. `composeSalesChannelsKernel` takes
  an optional `bridgeRegistry` and returns the one it used on `SalesChannelsKernel.bridgeRegistry`.

  For a consumer the visible change is at the call site: a membership call for an entity type **no
  installed module registered** now refuses with `503 MODULE_DISABLED`, naming the entity type in
  `error.details`, **before** it reaches the database. It previously executed SQL against the table
  the map named, which on an instance that never installed the owning module is a relation that does
  not exist — inside whatever transaction the caller had already opened. `ChannelMemberEntityType`
  is unchanged and stays the published vocabulary; the registry decides which of its members are
  live.

  `SalesChannelMembershipService`'s constructor takes the registry as an optional fourth argument,
  defaulting to the process-level one, so an existing construction site compiles and runs unchanged.

  **The module packages** — each now exports `salesChannelBridges`, the bridge or bridges it owns,
  from its `./backend` subpath, and registers them from a boot hook. `catalog` owns two (`product`
  and `category`); the other seven own one each. The registration is a contribution and carries no
  presence probe: the rows outlive an operator switching the module off, so the bridge stays
  readable, exactly as the asset-reference and language-reference registries state for their own
  contributions.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels`** — `SalesChannelsService` held a second copy of the same
  nine triples, read by the channel-delete sweep, justified by a circular import that had not existed
  since the membership service moved into the kernel. It is gone; the service takes the registry as a
  new required constructor argument, in fifth position, and the delete sweep iterates the bridges
  that are actually registered — so a channel can be deleted on an instance that never installed
  `cms`.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- e27bf6c: Every package that ships scannable UI now publishes its own Tailwind `@source`
  declarations at a new `./tailwind.css` subpath.

  A host compiling this package's utility classes no longer has to know where the
  package's sources are. Import the subpath from the stylesheet that builds your
  admin, and the package names its own layers:

  ```css
  @import 'tailwindcss';
  @import '@endora-commerce/mod-blog/tailwind.css';
  ```

  `@source` resolves relative to the stylesheet that declares it, so the paths hold
  wherever the package is installed. The file is generated from the package's layer
  inventory, ships in the tarball beside `package.json`, and its `dist` line is the one
  that matters to you — the `src` line beside it is inert in a published package and
  exists so that a checkout of this repository keeps scanning source in `dev`.

  **Nothing is removed or renamed**: every existing subpath resolves exactly as before.
  What is new is the obligation on the _host_ side, and it is a build error rather than a
  silent one. Before this, a host reached these packages with a glob over the monorepo
  (`@source "../../packages/**"`), which named a directory no installed tree has —
  and Tailwind reports nothing at all about a source that matches nothing, so such a host
  built green and rendered every screen unstyled. A host that now names a package that is
  not installed gets `Can't resolve`, and one whose tarball omits the file gets
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.

  `@endora-commerce/cms-components` deliberately does **not** publish this subpath. It
  ships a finished, prefixed stylesheet at `./styles.css` and must not also be scanned by
  its host.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- f11ccdb: `customers`, `organizations` and `sales_channels` ship their admin screens, and two icon names
  join the allowlist.

  **Three packages' `./admin` subpath gains `routes` and `nav`, and two of them gain the subpath
  itself.** `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels/admin` already exported `contributions` with a
  `zones` array and nothing else; it now declares its screens there too. `@endora-commerce/mod-customers`
  and `@endora-commerce/mod-organizations` had no `./admin` subpath at all and now declare one.
  Eight routes and six sidebar entries between them, at the paths and codes the hand-written host
  registrations carried. The exported symbol is the same one every other module package uses —
  `contributions`, an `AdminContributions` object, and nothing else — so a consumer already
  reading `sales_channels`' zones needs no edit.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-customers` — **new `./admin` subpath**, exporting `contributions`.
    `/customers` (the landing route), `/customers/online` and `/customers/:id`, all on
    `customers:read`, which is the code every `GET` behind them enforces; the detail screen keeps
    gating its block, unblock, impersonate, delete and restore controls on `customers:manage`
    inside itself. Two sidebar rows, in the `customers` section at weights 100 and 200. The detail
    screen is reached from the roster and has no row of its own. `CustomerDetail` renders the
    `customer.detail.after` zone, which is unchanged.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-organizations` — **new `./admin` subpath**, exporting `contributions`.
    `/organizations` and `/organizations/:id`, both on the **any-of pair**
    `['customers:read', 'customers:manage']`, which is what
    `requireAdminAny(['customers:read', 'customers:manage'])` enforces on every organization
    endpoint. `AdminNavDeclaration.requiredPermission` and `AdminRouteDeclaration.requiredPermission`
    both take a `PermissionRequirement`, so the pair is declared rather than collapsed: naming only
    the read code hides the screen from a role holding just `customers:manage`. One sidebar row, in
    the `customers` section at weight 300. `OrganizationDetail` renders the
    `organization.detail.after` zone — four modules contribute there — and that is unchanged.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels` — `/sales-channels` and `/sales-channels/:code` on
    `sales_channels:read`, and `/sales-channels/new` on `sales_channels:write`. **That last one is a
    behaviour change for a consumer rendering these routes**: the create form is a screen whose only
    purpose is a write, `POST /api/v1/admin/sales-channels` enforces `sales_channels:write`, and the
    module's own `new-sales-channel` palette action already advertised that code. It was ungated
    while the route was the admin application's, so an operator holding only `sales_channels:read`
    could open a form whose save then refused; the roster's _+ New channel_ button is gated on the
    same code in this release, so the dead end is closed at both ends. `credentials` ships the
    identical split for `/credentials/new`. One sidebar row, in the `channels` section at weight 100.
    `SalesChannelEditPage` renders the `sales_channel.editor.after` zone, which is unchanged.

  **`@endora-commerce/contracts` — two members join `KnownIconNameSchema`: `Building2` and
  `Store`.** They are the glyphs the admin application drew for `/organizations` and
  `/sales-channels` by hand. A contribution names its icon rather than importing it, so a name that
  is not on the allowlist degrades to the fallback; adding them is what keeps the two rows looking
  as they did. Widening an enum is additive for a consumer validating against it and breaking for
  one exhaustively switching over `KnownIconName` — there is no such consumer in this repository.

  **`@endora-commerce/admin-kit` — `resolveIcon` answers for both new names.** `ICON_MAP` gains
  `Building2` and `Store`; the function's signature is unchanged and every existing name resolves
  exactly as before.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-customers`, `@endora-commerce/mod-organizations` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels` ship new i18n keys, and `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n` loses
  six.** `nav.customers.label`, `nav.customersOnline.label`, `nav.organizations.label`,
  `nav.salesChannels.label` and the two new actions' `label`/`description` pairs are in the three
  modules' own `i18n/{en,pl}.json`; `appShell.nav.customers`, `appShell.nav.customersOnline`,
  `appShell.nav.organizations`, `appShell.nav.salesChannels`,
  `appShell.palette.sub.customerAccounts` and `appShell.palette.sub.storefrontChannels` are removed
  from the shared bundle in both shipped languages, nothing rendering them any more. **A consumer
  resolving one of those six keys out of the `core` namespace will get a raw key**; each has a
  module-namespaced replacement above.

  **`organizations` and `sales_channels` declare a new palette action each.**
  `open-organizations` (`/organizations`, `customers:read`) and `open-sales-channels`
  (`/sales-channels`, `sales_channels:read`) replace hand-written rows in the admin's own palette
  table — copies the server was never asked about, which went on advertising the screens whatever
  the effective enabled-set said. One narrowing comes with `open-organizations`:
  `ModuleActionSchema.requiredPermission` is a single string, so it names `customers:read` and a
  role holding only `customers:manage` loses the palette entry while keeping the sidebar one.

- 1ba52e1: `sales_channels.theme_code` is read. It had not been, since 2026-04-30.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels`** registers `GET
/api/v1/storefront/sales-channel`, the public read `PublicSalesChannelSchema`
  has described since feature `005-sales-channels` and that no route implemented.
  It answers `{ data: PublicSalesChannel }` for the channel the resolver picked
  for the request — code, display name, language and currency scopes, `themeCode`,
  `logoUrl` — and drops `id`, `active`, `systemDefault` and `version`. The channel
  comes from `getResolvedChannel()`, so the endpoint re-resolves nothing and
  writes no query of its own. `logoUrl` is `null`, as it is on the admin detail
  shape; resolving an asset id to a URL is a separate change.

  **`@endora-commerce/contracts`** adds, to `sales-channels.ts`:
  - `PublicSalesChannelResponseSchema` / `PublicSalesChannelResponse` — the
    envelope of the route above.
  - `STOREFRONT_THEME_CODES`, `StorefrontThemeCodeSchema`, `StorefrontThemeCode`,
    `DEFAULT_STOREFRONT_THEME_CODE` and `isStorefrontThemeCode` — the storefront
    themes that exist (`industria`, `nordic`). The admin's channel form renders a
    list from this instead of a free-text box, because a free-text box could store
    a code nothing implements, which is what it had been doing.

  Nothing is removed and no existing shape changes. **`SalesChannelCreateBodySchema`
  and `SalesChannelEditBodySchema` still validate `themeCode` against the
  `^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]*$` regex and not against the new enum**, deliberately: a
  deployment that forks the storefront owns its own theme codes, and a backend that
  refused them would make the field unusable for exactly those deployments. A code
  this storefront does not implement renders in the default theme and is reported
  in the storefront's log; it is never guessed at and never silently rewritten.

- eeb6a47: Four zone members for the category editor, the product editor and the sales-channel editor.

  `@endora-commerce/contracts` adds four members to `AdminZoneNameSchema`, each with its
  entry in `AdminZonePropsMap`:

  | Member                         | Props                                       | Rendered by                                           |
  | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
  | `category.editor.after`        | `CategoryEditorZoneProps { categoryId }`    | the category editor's form, after its save/cancel row |
  | `product.editor.pricing.after` | `ProductEditorZoneProps` (reused)           | the end of the product editor's Pricing tab           |
  | `product.editor.channels`      | `ProductEditorZoneProps` (reused)           | the body of the product editor's Channels tab         |
  | `sales_channel.editor.after`   | `SalesChannelEditorZoneProps { channelId }` | below the sales-channel editor's identity form        |

  `CategoryEditorZoneProps` and `SalesChannelEditorZoneProps` are new exported interfaces.
  `ProductEditorZoneProps` is reused for the two product members rather than aliased: a props
  type is the shape the mount carries, and two places in one editor that both carry a product
  id carry the same shape.

  ```tsx
  import { AdminZone, useAdminZone } from '@endora-commerce/admin-kit/zones';

  // A tab whose body is a zone shows its button by counting the zone, never by
  // naming the module that fills it.
  const contributions = useAdminZone('product.editor.channels', { productId });
  // …
  <AdminZone name="product.editor.channels" props={{ productId }} />;
  ```

  `@endora-commerce/mod-price-lists` gains an `./admin` subpath declaring two zone
  contributions — `category.editor.after` and `product.editor.pricing.after`, both at
  `price_lists:read` — and takes `DisplayModeOverrideRow` and `LinkedPriceListsPanel` with it.

  **`DisplayModeOverrideRow` loses its `label` and `inheritHint` props**, and that is a copy
  change an operator will see. A host cannot hand its own wording to a contributor it does not
  know, so the control renders `priceLists.displayMode.rowLabel` in every place it appears.
  Two screens read different words than before: the category editor, which passed `catalog`'s
  `categories.priceDisplayMode.label` / `.help` (both keys are removed from `catalog`'s
  bundle — hence its `patch`), and the product editor's Pricing tab, which passed this
  module's own `priceLists.linked.displayModeLabel` / `.displayModeHint`. Those two `core`
  keys are now read by nothing; they are left in place because the same props are still passed
  by `organizations`' detail screen, whose conversion is a separate merge request.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels` gains an `./admin` subpath declaring one contribution,
  `product.editor.channels` at `sales_channels:read`, and takes `EntityChannelMembership` with
  it. Its four calls are rebuilt from the published `apiClient` rather than moving
  `sales-channels-client`, so the package reaches nothing in the admin application.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-inventory` gains an `./admin` subpath declaring one contribution,
  `sales_channel.editor.after` at `inventory:read`, and takes the panel formerly at
  `admin/src/modules/warehouses/ChannelMembershipPanel.tsx`. Its own
  `isVisible({ module: 'inventory', requiredPermission: 'inventory:read' })` gate is gone —
  the zone renderer applies presence and that code before the chunk is fetched — while the
  `inventory:write` half stays, because a contribution declares one code and the panel offers
  a read view and write actions behind two.

  No contribution declares a `match`: each names a member exactly one host mounts, and `match`
  narrows the mounts of one place.

- 661e80d: Fourteen new packages: the **second** batch of modules to leave `backend/src/modules/`
  (feature 080, T040b). Five moved one at a time, then ten together; these fourteen are the
  same shape as the ten, and the properties below hold fourteen times over.

  **One changeset, not fourteen**, for the reason batch one gives: a changeset is written for
  the consumer of a package, and a package that did not exist a moment ago has no upgrader to
  instruct. What genuinely differs per package is its layer inventory, and that is the table.

  Every subpath is compiled output (D-164); none has a root wildcard; each package's `.` is
  its `manifest.ts`, where the generated manifest index reads the module's identity, its
  `dependencies`, its permission codes, its command-palette actions, its settings and its
  activation control.

  | Package                                     | Subpaths                         | Entities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Migrations | Ships          |

  **`./backend` publishes `registerModule(ctx)` and an `entities` array, and no entity class by
  name** (D-168) — type-only exports included, which this batch measured rather than assumed:
  two packages published their entities' row types so the dev seed could name them, and
  `module-package-entity-surface.test.ts` refused both, in as many words — _"that is the one
  thing that makes a foreign module's `import type { … }` compile"_. The exports are gone and
  the seed takes each class off the published array by name.

  **One of the fourteen owns no table and says so with an empty array rather than by
  omission.** `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels` exports `entities: readonly never[] = []`.
  The distinction is not cosmetic: the platform's package loader answers a _missing_ export
  with `[]`, so "this module has no table" and "somebody forgot the array" would otherwise
  arrive as one silence, whose only symptom is a query against a table nobody created.

  **One package publishes a type on `./backend` that is not an entity**, and it is there
  because a composition root has to name a contribution it supplies:
  `@endora-commerce/mod-shopping-lists` re-exports `ShoppingListService`. A root cannot reach
  a package's internal file — `rootDir` makes a relative specifier into `packages/` TS6059
  even for an `import type` — so a contribution shape has to be on a published subpath or it
  is unnameable.

  **Two packages declare a `@fastify/*` dependency nothing imports.**
  `@endora-commerce/mod-mfa` peers on `@fastify/cookie` and `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa` on
  `@fastify/multipart`, because `reply.setCookie`, `request.isMultipart()` and
  `request.file()` are declaration-merging augmentations rather than imports. Inside the
  application those arrived ambiently through the host's own dependency; a package compiles
  against its own manifest, where an unnamed dependency does not exist. Both write
  `import type {} from '@fastify/…'`, which is type-only: the plugin is still the host's to
  register.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter` and `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa` also carry a companion
  `@types/*` in `devDependencies`** — `@types/nodemailer` and `@types/web-push` — which the
  manifest generator now derives. Nothing imports a `@types` package; the compiler finds it
  through `node_modules/@types`, which inside a package is the package's own declaration, so
  a module importing a JS-only library did not build until this landed.

- 184fa9f: Two detail-screen zone members, four contributors, and the end of two live component
  duplications.

  `@endora-commerce/contracts` adds two members to `AdminZoneNameSchema`, each with its entry
  in `AdminZonePropsMap`:

  | Member                      | Props                                            | Rendered by                                         |
  | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
  | `organization.detail.after` | `OrganizationDetailZoneProps { organizationId }` | the end of the organization detail screen, **once** |
  | `customer.detail.after`     | `CustomerDetailZoneProps { customerId }`         | the end of the customer detail screen, **once**     |

  `OrganizationDetailZoneProps` and `CustomerDetailZoneProps` are new exported interfaces. The
  second is not an alias of the first: the prop is named for the entity the mount carries, and
  the two members are two places.

  **One mount per screen is a rule, not a layout choice.** Neither member carries a prop that
  could tell two mounts apart, so a second mount of either renders every contribution twice
  and nothing in the renderer can distinguish them.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-quick-order` gains an `./admin` subpath — its first — with two zone
  contributions and `DefaultPreferencesPanel`, which moves into the package. The panel's two
  preference calls are rebuilt from the published `apiClient`; `quick-order-client.ts` stays in
  the admin application, where the on-behalf-of screen still uses it.

  ```tsx
  // Both contributions declare `orders:write`, which is the code every admin
  // route this module owns enforces. There is no `quick_order:*` permission.
  zoneComponent('organization.detail.after', () => import('./zones/OrganizationDefaults.js'), {
    weight: 300,
    requiredPermission: 'orders:write',
  });
  ```

  `@endora-commerce/mod-carts` gains its first zone contribution and a new route,
  `GET /api/v1/admin/organizations/:id/cart-approval-policy`, gated on `customers:manage` and
  answering `cartApprovalPolicyResponseSchema` — the same code and the same shape as the
  `PATCH` that has been there since feature 027. `CartApprovalService` gains `getPolicyByAdmin`.
  The contribution reads its own initial state through that route instead of taking the
  `initialRequiresCartApproval` prop the old panel took, because a zone's props cannot carry a
  value only one of four contributors wants.

  That panel had been imported by nothing, and the copy it rendered was in no bundle under any
  spelling — `t('carts.policy.title')` under the `carts` namespace resolves to
  `bundle['carts']['carts.policy.title']`, which never existed. Ten `policy.*` keys are added to
  this package's own bundle in both shipped languages, and the capability reaches an operator
  for the first time.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-price-lists` and `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels` each gain a
  second contribution over a component they already ship, and each loses its duplicate:
  `DisplayModeOverrideRow` and `EntityChannelMembership` existed twice in the tree for the
  length of the previous release, because the organization detail screen still imported the
  `admin/src` copy. Both copies are gone and nothing imports them.

  **Operator-visible copy change.** The organization detail's pricing card is now
  `price_lists`' own: the screen used to pass `organizations.detail.pricingLabel` and
  `organizations.detail.pricingHint` into a control it does not own and wrap it in a card
  titled `organizations.detail.pricingCard`. A host cannot hand copy to a contributor it does
  not know, so the control renders `priceLists.displayMode.rowLabel` and its own hint, and all
  three host keys are removed from the `core` bundle in both languages. Two further `core` keys
  go with them — `priceLists.linked.displayModeLabel` and `priceLists.linked.displayModeHint`,
  which the previous release left unread.

  No contribution declares a `match`, and each says why in its own file: `match` narrows the
  mounts of one place, and each of these members has one host and one mount. Every zone test
  asserts it absent.

### Patch Changes

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.

- 54587bf: `sales_channels` declares the twelve error codes it owns.

  `manifest.ts` gains an `errorCodes` array — feature 090 Phase 3
  (`specs/090-module-owned-error-codes/`). Nothing the package exports changes
  shape. The observable difference for a consumer is that this module's error
  sentences are now routed by its own declaration rather than only by the prefix
  chain in `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`, which continues to answer identically for
  every one of them: the list is the chain's own answer, copied verbatim from the
  frozen capture, and is asserted equal to it in both directions.

  `UNKNOWN_OPTION` is deliberately not among them. This module's rule in the chain
  is the `UNKNOWN_` prefix, but `catalog` claims that code two branches earlier, so
  the chain's answer is `catalog` and the declaration follows the answer.

  All twelve already carry a written sentence in both `en` and `pl` in this
  package's own `i18n/` bundles, so no sentence moves and none is added. No
  `tokens`: no raise site of any of the twelve passes a `details.code`
  discriminator.
