### Minor Changes

- b8ad861: Sales-rep assignment and organization parentage are platform-admin writes — a scoped admin now gets `403`

  **If your operator has a scoped admin role that assigns sales representatives or moves
  organizations in the tree, this release makes those calls fail with `403 FORBIDDEN`.**
  Three route handlers changed; no entity, service, DTO or migration did.
  - `POST /api/v1/admin/organizations/:organizationId/sales-reps`
  - `DELETE /api/v1/admin/organizations/:organizationId/sales-reps/:adminUserId`
  - `POST /api/v1/admin/organizations/:id/parent`

  All three were gated on a `requireAdmin(...)` permission code alone, and a permission code is
  not a tenancy boundary. `OrganizationSalesRepAssignment` is the table that _defines_ an
  `allowed-set` actor's `allowedOrganizationIds`, and `Organization.parentId` is what the
  roll-up capability expands over, so an actor resolving to `allowed-set` could widen **its own
  authority**: measured at `[orgA] → [orgA, orgB]` by one self-assignment (answered `201`) and
  again by one re-parent (answered `200`). Both entities are `@GlobalEntity` and correctly so —
  the assignment table cannot be `@OrgScoped` without circularity — so no classification and no
  column filter could reach either write.

  What changes for a consumer, in the order you will meet it:
  - **The three routes require `mode: 'all'`.** A platform admin and a `system` caller are
    unaffected and keep writing across organizations exactly as before. An `allowed-set` or
    `single-org` actor is refused `403 FORBIDDEN` with a message naming no organization.
  - **The refusal is categorical, including for the actor's own organization.** Assigning a
    second representative to an organization you already hold still edits the graph that decides
    who holds what. The graph is the boundary, not an operation inside it.
  - **The gate answers before the existence lookup**, so the refusal does not depend on the
    organization or the admin user being there, and the response is the same either way.
  - **Only the routes moved.** `SalesRepAssignmentPort.assign` / `.unassign` are unchanged, so an
    ERP import or an install hook calling the exported service — `comarch_xl`'s contractor apply
    is one — keeps working under its own `system` scope.

  `minor` rather than `major` because no package in this repository leaves `0.x` yet; in a `0.x`
  series a minor already takes every caret dependent out of range, which is the consumer-facing
  meaning of the break.

  Implements D-260's rule that a write which changes the acting principal's own authority cannot
  be authorised by that authority. The idiom is this module's own credit-inheritance-mode
  handler, which already required `mode: 'all'` on the weaker argument of a money-behaviour
  switch.

### Patch Changes

- 8f61a6b: Every published package now ships its own `LICENSE` and `README.md`.

  npm force-includes a file named `LICENSE` into the tarball exactly as it does `README.md`,
  whatever `files` says, so the text has to be in the package directory and not only at the
  repository root — `LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md` states that rule and, until this release, no package
  obeyed it. Measured on `master`: **0** of the 82 publishable packages carried a `LICENSE` and
  **14** carried a `README.md`, so every tarball shipped without licence text and 68 registry
  pages would have rendered empty.

  Both files are **generated**, by `pnpm --filter backend run manifests:generate`, and refused
  when stale by `manifests:check` in the `quality` job:
  - the `LICENSE` is the repository's root `LICENSE`, copied verbatim — the same single source
    the `license: MIT` field is already rendered from. A package that declares a licence of its
    own in the `SEE LICENSE IN <file>` form is skipped and keeps the file it names.
  - the `README.md` is rendered from what the package's own manifest declares: its description,
    its module id where it has one, every published subpath with what that layer holds, its peer
    dependencies with the optional ones marked, the locales its `i18n/` carries and what the
    tarball ships. A `README.md` **without** the generated marker on its first line is a human's
    and is never rewritten — the fourteen that existed are untouched.

  Five module packages also get their npm description back. `@endora-commerce/mod-blog`,
  `mod-credit-limits`, `mod-dhl-parcel`, `mod-google-analytics` and `mod-quote-requests` carried
  the note written when they were moved out of `backend/src/modules` — _"the first module to
  leave backend/src/modules … the manifest id stays identity of record"_ — as the sentence a
  registry shows under the package name. Each now carries the sentence its own module manifest
  declares, which is where `descriptionFor` seeds one from in the first place.

  No API changes, no new dependency, no behaviour change: what moves is what the tarball carries
  and what a package page says.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 0eeb9b5: Require Node >= 22.18.0.

  The previous floor was 22.17.0, which MikroORM 7 sets. 22.18.0 is the first release that
  strips TypeScript types without a flag, and that is what loads a deployment's overlay module:
  in a scaffolded instance `apps/` is outside every compiled member, so the unit the platform
  `import()`s is the client's own `.ts`. On 22.17.x that import throws
  `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` and the process dies before it listens. Emitting a `.js` beside
  the client's source was measured and refused — the overlay loader resolves `.js` before `.ts`
  while the divergence derivation admits both, so the sibling doubles every seam site in the
  report.

  Derived by probing 22.17.0, 22.17.1, 22.18.0 and 22.19.0 against a `.ts` module imported with
  no flag; 22.18.0 is the lowest that loads it.

  If you run 22.17.x, upgrade to 22.18 or later. Nothing else in these packages changed.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- bd596a9: The sales-channel bridge tables are declared by the modules that own them, not by the platform.

  **`@endora-commerce/platform`** — `SalesChannelMembershipService` no longer holds a map total over
  `ChannelMemberEntityTypeSchema`. It resolves `{ table, entityIdColumn }` through a new
  `ChannelBridgeRegistry`, which each owning module fills at compose time, and a composition root
  contributes as the container name `salesChannelBridgeRegistry`. `composeSalesChannelsKernel` takes
  an optional `bridgeRegistry` and returns the one it used on `SalesChannelsKernel.bridgeRegistry`.

  For a consumer the visible change is at the call site: a membership call for an entity type **no
  installed module registered** now refuses with `503 MODULE_DISABLED`, naming the entity type in
  `error.details`, **before** it reaches the database. It previously executed SQL against the table
  the map named, which on an instance that never installed the owning module is a relation that does
  not exist — inside whatever transaction the caller had already opened. `ChannelMemberEntityType`
  is unchanged and stays the published vocabulary; the registry decides which of its members are
  live.

  `SalesChannelMembershipService`'s constructor takes the registry as an optional fourth argument,
  defaulting to the process-level one, so an existing construction site compiles and runs unchanged.

  **The module packages** — each now exports `salesChannelBridges`, the bridge or bridges it owns,
  from its `./backend` subpath, and registers them from a boot hook. `catalog` owns two (`product`
  and `category`); the other seven own one each. The registration is a contribution and carries no
  presence probe: the rows outlive an operator switching the module off, so the bridge stays
  readable, exactly as the asset-reference and language-reference registries state for their own
  contributions.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels`** — `SalesChannelsService` held a second copy of the same
  nine triples, read by the channel-delete sweep, justified by a circular import that had not existed
  since the membership service moved into the kernel. It is gone; the service takes the registry as a
  new required constructor argument, in fifth position, and the delete sweep iterates the bridges
  that are actually registered — so a channel can be deleted on an instance that never installed
  `cms`.

- 2fe0b8d: Each sales-channel bridge table is now created by the module that owns its far side.

  Under D-226 a bridge between an always-present near side and a switchable far side belongs to the
  far side. All nine `sales_channel_*` tables move accordingly, so an instance that does not install
  `cms` no longer carries a migration corpus naming `cms_pages`.

  **Nothing is re-offered to a database you have already migrated, and no reset is required.**
  `mikro_orm_migrations` stores the migration class **name** and no checksum — measured on
  `@mikro-orm/migrations@6.6.13`: `MigrationStorage.ensureTable()` builds `id`, `name` and
  `executed_at`, `logMigration` inserts `{ name }`, and `getPendingMigrations()` is `umzug.pending()`
  over those names. No class is renamed and no stamp moves, so the two edited bodies are not pending
  anywhere.

  **`@endora-commerce/platform`** — two frozen migrations lose statements and keep their class names.
  `Migration20260430T170044CoreSalesChannelsPromote` loses eight `create table "sales_channel_*"`
  statements with their indexes from `up()` and the matching eight `drop table` from `down()`;
  `Migration20260424T165847CoreFoundationInit` loses `create table "sales_channel_products"`, its
  index and its `drop table`. Everything those migrations do to a kernel table is untouched — the
  channel identity columns, the backfills, the one-system-default partial unique index and the
  `quote_requests.sales_channel_id` column all stay exactly where they were. `BASELINE_MIGRATIONS` is
  byte-identical, so no position in the frozen prefix moves.

  **Each far-side module** gains one migration (`@endora-commerce/mod-catalog` gains two, for
  `sales_channel_products` and `sales_channel_categories`). Each is a `create table if not exists`
  carrying the frozen statement's own column list, primary key, both foreign keys and index, plus a
  `create index if not exists`, and each drops its own table in `down()`. On a database that has
  applied the frozen migrations every one of them is a no-op: measured on a throwaway database
  migrated at the previous release and then upgraded, all nine relations keep their `pg_class` OID,
  so no table is recreated and no row is touched. On a fresh database they are the creation, later in
  the computed order than before — which is where they have to be for an instance that omits one of
  these modules to migrate at all.

  **One behaviour changes on purpose.** A hard uninstall reverts by registry `moduleId`, so
  `module:uninstall --hard cms` now drops `sales_channel_cms_pages` along with the rest of that
  module's schema. That is the ownership rule doing what it says, and it is what an operator would
  expect of a table whose far side has just been removed.

  The published `ChannelMemberEntityTypeSchema` vocabulary is unchanged, and no wire shape moves.

### Patch Changes

- 6c8d958: Eight migration statements move to the module whose dependency closure guarantees the table they
  name (D-226, `specs/120-migration-closure-bridge-ownership/` Phase 3).

  A migration may name a table only if its own module creates it, a module in its transitive manifest
  `dependencies` closure creates it, or the platform creates it. Where that did not hold, an instance
  that omitted the creating module could not migrate a fresh database at all — the failure this rule
  was ruled from was `relation "cms_pages" does not exist`.

  **No class is renamed and no stamp moves.** `mikro_orm_migrations` persists the migration class name
  and holds no checksum (measured on `@mikro-orm/migrations@6.6.13`), so a database that has applied
  one of the reduced bodies is offered nothing from it. What an upgrading consumer receives is the
  five new migrations below, each written idempotently, each a no-op against a database that already
  has the object and the real change against a fresh one. Measured on a database migrated at the
  previous revision: exactly five pending, every table's `pg_class` OID unchanged after applying
  them, and the resulting schema byte-identical to the previous revision's fresh schema.

  **`@endora-commerce/platform`** — two frozen bodies lose statements they could never have been
  ordered for, the platform declaring no dependencies and so never being orderable after a module's
  table. `Migration20260430T170044CoreSalesChannelsPromote` no longer adds `quote_requests.sales_channel_id`,
  its foreign key or its index. `Migration20260717T134752CoreTenantScopeIndexes` is now **empty** —
  all three of its indexes were on module-owned tables — and the class stays, because its name is on
  `BASELINE_MIGRATIONS` and removing it would move seventy frozen positions.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-quote-requests`** — new `Migration20260912T125614QuoteRequestsQuoteRequestChannelAttribution`:
  the `sales_channel_id` column, its `ON DELETE RESTRICT` foreign key and its index, `add column if not exists`
  with the constraint add guarded by a `pg_constraint` probe. The column is still NULLABLE.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-analytics`** — new `Migration20260912T125655AnalyticsEventsTenantScopeIndexes`:
  the two tenant-key indexes on `analytics_events`, verbatim and `if not exists`.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter`** — new `Migration20260912T125702NewsletterSubscriberTenantScopeIndex`:
  the tenant-key index on `newsletter_subscribers.customer_account_id`, verbatim and `if not exists`.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-cms`** — new `Migration20260912T125709CmsPageBodyAssetRefIndex`: the GIN
  index on `cms_pages.body`. It exists for `assets_library`' reference-protection scan and now lives
  with the table it is on; `cms` declares `assets_library` and not the other way round, so this is the
  only direction in which the closure holds.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-assets-library`** — `Migration20260505T102206AssetsLibraryInit` no longer
  creates that index. An instance installing this package without `cms` no longer carries a migration
  that indexes a table nothing builds.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-inventory`** — new `Migration20260912T125716InventoryOrganizationWarehouses`:
  the `organization_warehouses` bridge, `create table if not exists`, verbatim columns, primary key and
  both foreign keys. This is D-226's bridge rule one namespace over — an always-present near side
  (`organizations`) and a switchable far side — and it has a visible consequence:
  `module:uninstall --hard inventory` now reverts this table, a hard uninstall reverting by registry
  module id.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-organizations`** — `Migration20260611T140349OrganizationsConsolidation` no
  longer creates `organization_warehouses`. Its `warehouses` foreign key named a table this module
  neither owns nor declares, and could not declare: `inventory` already declares `organizations`.

### Minor Changes

- 72013ed: Published `OrganizationTaxProfilePort`, and moved the error envelope's assembly into the
  platform.

  **`@endora-commerce/contracts` gains `OrganizationTaxProfilePort`.** It described the
  `organizationTaxProfilePort` container name and was declared by
  `@endora-commerce/mod-organizations/backend`, so a consumer resolving that port had to name
  the provider's own package to spell the type — which is the reach a port exists to remove,
  and which `@endora-commerce/platform` may not write at all. The declaration is unchanged
  member for member.

  ```diff
  -import type { OrganizationTaxProfilePort } from '@endora-commerce/mod-organizations/backend';
  +import type { OrganizationTaxProfilePort } from '@endora-commerce/contracts';

   const taxProfile = lazyPort<OrganizationTaxProfilePort>(ctx, 'organizationTaxProfilePort');
  ```

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-organizations/backend` no longer exports it**, and that is the
  breaking half. A re-export was written and withdrawn: a barrel re-exporting a name whose
  source is another package makes _"does this barrel carry an entity class by name"_ unknown
  rather than false, which D-168 may not be wrong about, and two spellings for one type is the
  shape this repository removes rather than adds. Change the specifier; the type is
  unchanged.

  **`@endora-commerce/platform/composition` gains `composeErrorEnvelopeOptions` and loses
  `createRequestLanguageResolver`.** The two callbacks a composition root passes to
  `registerErrorEnvelope` — the language ladder and the translation lookup — were assembled
  by each root itself, identically, in twenty lines apiece. They are one function now, and
  what a root supplies is only what a root knows: its own resolved error-code routing table
  and the two container names the callbacks read.

  ```diff
  -errorEnvelope: {
  -  errorTranslationTargets: routing.targets,
  -  resolvePreferredLanguage: createRequestLanguageResolver({
  -    adminPreferredLanguage: async (id) =>
  -      (await adminUserReadPort().findById(id))?.preferredLanguage ?? null,
  -  }),
  -  translateErrorMessage: async ({ moduleId, key, language, originalMessage, params }) => {
  -    const t = await i18n().translate(moduleId, key, language, params);
  -    return t === `${moduleId}.${key}` ? originalMessage : t;
  -  },
  -},
  +errorEnvelope: composeErrorEnvelopeOptions({
  +  errorTranslationTargets: routing.targets,
  +  adminUserReadPort: () => identityPorts().adminUserReadPort,
  +  translate: () => cradle().adminI18nService,
  +}),
  ```

  `createRequestLanguageResolver` is off the barrel because no composition root constructs it
  any more; the ladder it builds is unchanged and is now built inside the assembly. If you
  called it directly, call `composeErrorEnvelopeOptions` instead. Both are on `./composition`,
  which is host-internal — no module may name it — so this affects a host and never a module.

- 6e037cd: The module declares its demo data: `manifest.demo` creates the buying organisation the demo shop
  trades with, and withdraws it again.

  `endora demo seed` now reports `organizations` by name with what it created, and `endora demo
reset` removes it. Both bodies are reached by a relative `await import()` from the manifest, so
  nothing is loaded by the processes that merely compose the platform, and the module gained no
  `exports` subpath, no `files` entry and no manifest `dependencies` entry.

  **The withdrawal changed, and on this table it is the sharpest repair in the batch.** The host's
  demo reset cleared `organizations` with a `truncate … cascade`, and an organisation is the tenant
  every buyer, address, cart, quote request and order hangs off — so one word took a developer's
  entire test tenancy with it, silently, on every seed. The reset now deletes only the tax id
  `seed` assigns.

  **The demo buyer and the demo credit limit are not this module's demo data.** Each is another
  module's row against this one's, so each stays with the instance composition.

  Seeding twice creates nothing the second time and reports the same count.

- e27bf6c: Every package that ships scannable UI now publishes its own Tailwind `@source`
  declarations at a new `./tailwind.css` subpath.

  A host compiling this package's utility classes no longer has to know where the
  package's sources are. Import the subpath from the stylesheet that builds your
  admin, and the package names its own layers:

  ```css
  @import 'tailwindcss';
  @import '@endora-commerce/mod-blog/tailwind.css';
  ```

  `@source` resolves relative to the stylesheet that declares it, so the paths hold
  wherever the package is installed. The file is generated from the package's layer
  inventory, ships in the tarball beside `package.json`, and its `dist` line is the one
  that matters to you — the `src` line beside it is inert in a published package and
  exists so that a checkout of this repository keeps scanning source in `dev`.

  **Nothing is removed or renamed**: every existing subpath resolves exactly as before.
  What is new is the obligation on the _host_ side, and it is a build error rather than a
  silent one. Before this, a host reached these packages with a glob over the monorepo
  (`@source "../../packages/**"`), which named a directory no installed tree has —
  and Tailwind reports nothing at all about a source that matches nothing, so such a host
  built green and rendered every screen unstyled. A host that now names a package that is
  not installed gets `Can't resolve`, and one whose tarball omits the file gets
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.

  `@endora-commerce/cms-components` deliberately does **not** publish this subpath. It
  ships a finished, prefixed stylesheet at `./styles.css` and must not also be scanned by
  its host.

### Minor Changes

- f11ccdb: `customers`, `organizations` and `sales_channels` ship their admin screens, and two icon names
  join the allowlist.

  **Three packages' `./admin` subpath gains `routes` and `nav`, and two of them gain the subpath
  itself.** `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels/admin` already exported `contributions` with a
  `zones` array and nothing else; it now declares its screens there too. `@endora-commerce/mod-customers`
  and `@endora-commerce/mod-organizations` had no `./admin` subpath at all and now declare one.
  Eight routes and six sidebar entries between them, at the paths and codes the hand-written host
  registrations carried. The exported symbol is the same one every other module package uses —
  `contributions`, an `AdminContributions` object, and nothing else — so a consumer already
  reading `sales_channels`' zones needs no edit.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-customers` — **new `./admin` subpath**, exporting `contributions`.
    `/customers` (the landing route), `/customers/online` and `/customers/:id`, all on
    `customers:read`, which is the code every `GET` behind them enforces; the detail screen keeps
    gating its block, unblock, impersonate, delete and restore controls on `customers:manage`
    inside itself. Two sidebar rows, in the `customers` section at weights 100 and 200. The detail
    screen is reached from the roster and has no row of its own. `CustomerDetail` renders the
    `customer.detail.after` zone, which is unchanged.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-organizations` — **new `./admin` subpath**, exporting `contributions`.
    `/organizations` and `/organizations/:id`, both on the **any-of pair**
    `['customers:read', 'customers:manage']`, which is what
    `requireAdminAny(['customers:read', 'customers:manage'])` enforces on every organization
    endpoint. `AdminNavDeclaration.requiredPermission` and `AdminRouteDeclaration.requiredPermission`
    both take a `PermissionRequirement`, so the pair is declared rather than collapsed: naming only
    the read code hides the screen from a role holding just `customers:manage`. One sidebar row, in
    the `customers` section at weight 300. `OrganizationDetail` renders the
    `organization.detail.after` zone — four modules contribute there — and that is unchanged.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels` — `/sales-channels` and `/sales-channels/:code` on
    `sales_channels:read`, and `/sales-channels/new` on `sales_channels:write`. **That last one is a
    behaviour change for a consumer rendering these routes**: the create form is a screen whose only
    purpose is a write, `POST /api/v1/admin/sales-channels` enforces `sales_channels:write`, and the
    module's own `new-sales-channel` palette action already advertised that code. It was ungated
    while the route was the admin application's, so an operator holding only `sales_channels:read`
    could open a form whose save then refused; the roster's _+ New channel_ button is gated on the
    same code in this release, so the dead end is closed at both ends. `credentials` ships the
    identical split for `/credentials/new`. One sidebar row, in the `channels` section at weight 100.
    `SalesChannelEditPage` renders the `sales_channel.editor.after` zone, which is unchanged.

  **`@endora-commerce/contracts` — two members join `KnownIconNameSchema`: `Building2` and
  `Store`.** They are the glyphs the admin application drew for `/organizations` and
  `/sales-channels` by hand. A contribution names its icon rather than importing it, so a name that
  is not on the allowlist degrades to the fallback; adding them is what keeps the two rows looking
  as they did. Widening an enum is additive for a consumer validating against it and breaking for
  one exhaustively switching over `KnownIconName` — there is no such consumer in this repository.

  **`@endora-commerce/admin-kit` — `resolveIcon` answers for both new names.** `ICON_MAP` gains
  `Building2` and `Store`; the function's signature is unchanged and every existing name resolves
  exactly as before.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-customers`, `@endora-commerce/mod-organizations` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels` ship new i18n keys, and `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n` loses
  six.** `nav.customers.label`, `nav.customersOnline.label`, `nav.organizations.label`,
  `nav.salesChannels.label` and the two new actions' `label`/`description` pairs are in the three
  modules' own `i18n/{en,pl}.json`; `appShell.nav.customers`, `appShell.nav.customersOnline`,
  `appShell.nav.organizations`, `appShell.nav.salesChannels`,
  `appShell.palette.sub.customerAccounts` and `appShell.palette.sub.storefrontChannels` are removed
  from the shared bundle in both shipped languages, nothing rendering them any more. **A consumer
  resolving one of those six keys out of the `core` namespace will get a raw key**; each has a
  module-namespaced replacement above.

  **`organizations` and `sales_channels` declare a new palette action each.**
  `open-organizations` (`/organizations`, `customers:read`) and `open-sales-channels`
  (`/sales-channels`, `sales_channels:read`) replace hand-written rows in the admin's own palette
  table — copies the server was never asked about, which went on advertising the screens whatever
  the effective enabled-set said. One narrowing comes with `open-organizations`:
  `ModuleActionSchema.requiredPermission` is a single string, so it names `customers:read` and a
  role holding only `customers:manage` loses the palette entry while keeping the sidebar one.

- 94e8f3f: Publish `OrganizationTreeService`, `TargetValidatorDeps` and `StorefrontDeps`
  from each package's `./backend` subpath.

  The composition root contributes these shapes and must name their types. It
  reached the source files by relative path, which is `TS6059` under the
  backend's build `rootDir` — even for an `import type`, since a type-only
  import still joins the program — so `pnpm --filter backend run build` was red
  and the production image could not be built.

- cf97e05: The organization approval and rejection e-mails are sent in the recipient's language.

  Both were composed as hard-coded Polish sentences inside
  `OrganizationModerationService` and handed straight to `EmailMailerPort.send` with no
  code, no template and no language, so a buyer on an English sales channel received
  Polish unconditionally.

  The module now declares two transactional e-mails, `organization_approved` and
  `organization_rejected`, ships `en-US` and `pl-PL` content for both, and routes the two
  messages through `templateEmailPort`, which resolves the language from the
  system-default sales channel and falls back to `en-US`. English is the primary copy and
  the fallback tier; the Polish is the copy these messages already shipped.

  `OrganizationModerationService`'s constructor takes an eighth argument, the
  `TemplateEmailPort` adapter. It is optional and defaults to the no-op, so an existing
  caller keeps compiling and keeps sending — through the English in-code builders, which
  remain as the tier reached when the platform holds no definition for a code.

- efa4111: Six more modules become workspace packages (feature 080, T040b batch five):
  `admin_actions`, `admin_roles`, `admin_users`, `megamenu`, `organizations` and
  `price_lists`. Each ships `dist` and resolves through its own `exports` map — the
  root for its manifest, `./backend` for `registerModule` plus the `entities`
  array, `./migrations` for its migration classes where it owns any — exactly as
  the fifty-three packages before them.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-organizations` publishes a `./ports` subpath.** It is
  type-only: `tsc` emits `export {};`, and it is where a consumer names
  `PersonalOrganizationProvisionApi` and `PersonalOrganizationProvisionInput`
  instead of reaching into the owner's directory.

  ```ts
  import type { PersonalOrganizationProvisionApi } from '@endora-commerce/mod-organizations/ports';
  ```

  The implementation stays behind the container name
  `personalOrganizationProvisionPort`, resolved with `lazyPort`, so the gate that
  answers 503 `MODULE_DISABLED` when `organizations` is switched off is still the
  registration and not a call anyone has to remember to write.

  **Three packages publish a runtime binding by name, beside the `entities`
  array.** D-168 keeps entity classes off `./backend`; these are not entities, and
  each is exported because a host program must hold the _same_ copy the platform
  composed rather than a second one evaluated from source (D-160.6.1):
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-admin-roles/backend` — `PermissionCatalogueService`,
    `listAssignablePermissionCodes`, and the inventory scanner
    (`ConstantResolver`, `defaultScanRoots`, `scanEnforcedPermissionCodes`,
    `scanEnforcedPermissionGates`). The acceptance instance probe and
    `check:action-route-permissions` read them.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-price-lists/backend` — `DefaultPriceListMigrator`,
    `DEFAULT_PRICE_LIST_ID` and `PriceListService`. The development catalog seed
    runs the migrator; a second copy would `em.create` a `PriceList` class the ORM
    never registered, which fails at the first insert rather than at load.

  **Nothing about a module's behaviour changed.** No manifest `dependencies` array
  moved, so the migration order is the same function of the same inputs: the
  committed registry's `(moduleId, className)` declaration sequence and its
  computed execution sequence are byte-identical to the merge base over all 164
  entries.

### Patch Changes

- d7dca40: Error-code ownership: `organizations` declares the eight codes it owns and ships its first i18n
  bundle.

  `CANNOT_REVOKE_LAST_ADMIN_INVITE`, `EMAIL_ALREADY_IN_ORGANIZATION`,
  `EMAIL_BELONGS_TO_ANOTHER_ORGANIZATION`, `ORGANIZATION_HAS_CHILDREN`, `ORGANIZATION_SUSPENDED`,
  `ORGANIZATION_TAX_ID_EXISTS`, `ORGANIZATION_TREE_INVALID` and `ORG_OWNER_DEPLETION` move from
  `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`'s manifest to `@endora-commerce/mod-organizations`'. For a consumer the
  observable difference is **which bundle answers for them**: the sentences are no longer served from
  the platform bundle and are now in this module's own `i18n/{en,pl}.json`, so a deployment that
  ships `@endora-commerce/mod-organizations` gets them and one that does not gets the raising code's
  own English. Two of the eight are raised by another module — `ORG_OWNER_DEPLETION` by
  `@endora-commerce/mod-customers` and `ORGANIZATION_SUSPENDED` by `@endora-commerce/mod-orders` — so
  for those two the sentence and the raise now ship in different packages.

  Five of the eight arrive with prose written for the first time; they carried a machine-shaped
  restatement of their own code (`"Organization Suspended."`), which is deleted rather than moved.
  `ORG_OWNER_DEPLETION` had no sentence in either language and now has one.

  **Three token sub-keys are new and are the ones the error envelope actually reads.** Every raise of
  `ORGANIZATION_HAS_CHILDREN` and `ORGANIZATION_TREE_INVALID` carries a `details.code`, so the
  envelope looks up `errors.<CODE>.<token>`: `errors.ORGANIZATION_HAS_CHILDREN.has_children`,
  `errors.ORGANIZATION_TREE_INVALID.cycle` and `errors.ORGANIZATION_TREE_INVALID.max_depth_exceeded`.
  Until now only the base keys existed and neither code rendered a translated sentence at all.

  **The 422 `ORGANIZATION_TREE_INVALID` depth response now carries `details.maxDepth`** beside its
  `code`, a number. It carried the token alone before, while the English message named the bound —
  so a translated sentence had no way to say how deep is too deep. This is additive; the member is
  `maxDepth` and never a second `code`, which is the refusal token.

  **`cycleRefusal()`, `maxDepthRefusal(maxDepth?)` and `hasChildrenRefusal()` are new exports** of
  `@endora-commerce/mod-organizations/backend`'s `services/organization-tree-service.js`. They are the
  refusals the tree rules and the admin delete route already threw, extracted as pure functions for
  the reason `@endora-commerce/mod-admin-roles`' `roleInUseRefusal` was: only a test that renders a
  real refusal against the bundle can see that the token, the key and the placeholder agree.

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.
