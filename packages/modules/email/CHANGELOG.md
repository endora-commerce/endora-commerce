# @endora-commerce/mod-email

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- e637f56: Seven more modules become workspace packages (feature 080, T040b batch four):
  `assets_library`, `carts`, `custom_fields`, `customers`, `email`, `invoices` and
  `settings`. Each ships `dist` and resolves through its own `exports` map — the
  root for its manifest, `./backend` for `registerModule` plus the `entities`
  array, `./migrations` for its migration classes where it owns any — exactly as
  the forty-three packages before them.

  Three things a consumer of one of these packages should know.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-carts`, `@endora-commerce/mod-custom-fields` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-invoices` publish a `./ports` subpath.** It is type-only:
  `tsc` emits `export {};`, and it is where a consumer names
  `CartPlacementApplyPort`, `CustomFieldDefinitionApplyApi` and
  `InvoicePlacementApplyPort` instead of reaching into the owner's directory.

  ```ts
  import type { CartPlacementApplyPort } from '@endora-commerce/mod-carts/ports';
  ```

  The implementations stay behind their container names
  (`cartPlacementApplyPort`, `customFieldDefinitionApplyApi`,
  `invoicePlacementApplyPort`) and are resolved with `lazyPort`, never through
  this subpath.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-settings` declares `entities` as an empty array.** The
  module owns no table — the settings store is the platform's — and the empty
  array is the statement, because the host reads a _missing_ export as `[]` and a
  forgotten one would be indistinguishable from an honest none.

  **No entity class is exported by name from any of the seven**, `import type`
  included (D-168). A consumer that must construct one takes it off the published
  `entities` array by name; `Cart`, `Invoice` and the rest are deliberately not
  importable.

### Patch Changes

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.
