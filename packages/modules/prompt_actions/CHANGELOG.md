### Patch Changes

- 32fdf20: The `LICENSE` file in each package now names the copyright holder as Endora sp. z o.o.

  The MIT licence text is unchanged; only its copyright line moves from `Copyright (c) 2026 Endora`
  to `Copyright (c) 2026 Endora sp. z o.o.`, the registered legal entity. Nothing a package exports,
  declares or depends on changes. `@endora-commerce/contracts` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-invoice-ledger` also carry a one-sentence rewording in an already-published
  `CHANGELOG.md` entry, with no change to what that entry says about the code.

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 8f61a6b: Every published package now ships its own `LICENSE` and `README.md`.

  npm force-includes a file named `LICENSE` into the tarball exactly as it does `README.md`,
  whatever `files` says, so the text has to be in the package directory and not only at the
  repository root — `LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md` states that rule and, until this release, no package
  obeyed it. Measured on `master`: **0** of the 82 publishable packages carried a `LICENSE` and
  **14** carried a `README.md`, so every tarball shipped without licence text and 68 registry
  pages would have rendered empty.

  Both files are **generated**, by `pnpm --filter backend run manifests:generate`, and refused
  when stale by `manifests:check` in the `quality` job:
  - the `LICENSE` is the repository's root `LICENSE`, copied verbatim — the same single source
    the `license: MIT` field is already rendered from. A package that declares a licence of its
    own in the `SEE LICENSE IN <file>` form is skipped and keeps the file it names.
  - the `README.md` is rendered from what the package's own manifest declares: its description,
    its module id where it has one, every published subpath with what that layer holds, its peer
    dependencies with the optional ones marked, the locales its `i18n/` carries and what the
    tarball ships. A `README.md` **without** the generated marker on its first line is a human's
    and is never rewritten — the fourteen that existed are untouched.

  Five module packages also get their npm description back. `@endora-commerce/mod-blog`,
  `mod-credit-limits`, `mod-dhl-parcel`, `mod-google-analytics` and `mod-quote-requests` carried
  the note written when they were moved out of `backend/src/modules` — _"the first module to
  leave backend/src/modules … the manifest id stays identity of record"_ — as the sentence a
  registry shows under the package name. Each now carries the sentence its own module manifest
  declares, which is where `descriptionFor` seeds one from in the first place.

  No API changes, no new dependency, no behaviour change: what moves is what the tarball carries
  and what a package page says.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 0eeb9b5: Require Node >= 22.18.0.

  The previous floor was 22.17.0, which MikroORM 7 sets. 22.18.0 is the first release that
  strips TypeScript types without a flag, and that is what loads a deployment's overlay module:
  in a scaffolded instance `apps/` is outside every compiled member, so the unit the platform
  `import()`s is the client's own `.ts`. On 22.17.x that import throws
  `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` and the process dies before it listens. Emitting a `.js` beside
  the client's source was measured and refused — the overlay loader resolves `.js` before `.ts`
  while the divergence derivation admits both, so the sibling doubles every seam site in the
  report.

  Derived by probing 22.17.0, 22.17.1, 22.18.0 and 22.19.0 against a `.ts` module imported with
  no flag; 22.18.0 is the lowest that loads it.

  If you run 22.17.x, upgrade to 22.18 or later. Nothing else in these packages changed.

## 0.7.0

### Major Changes

- 5253b3e: Four promise-form `catch`es stop swallowing `ModuleDisabledError`. Each is a call that
  answered "there is nothing here" for a capability the operator had switched off, and each
  therefore has a new contract for its caller.

  **Breaking — `OrderConfirmationService.resolveAdditional(organizationId, salesChannelId)`.**
  It documented "invalid or empty entries are dropped, never fatal" and returned `[]` for any
  failure of the organisation read, which goes through `organizationDetailsPort`. It now
  rejects with `ModuleDisabledError` when `organizations` is absent and still returns `[]` for
  every other failure.

      // before — an order confirmed with the buyer as its only recipient
      const extra = await confirmation.resolveAdditional(orgId, channelId);

      // after — the caller decides, because it can now tell the two apart
      let extra: string[];
      try {
        extra = await confirmation.resolveAdditional(orgId, channelId);
      } catch (error) {
        rethrowIfModuleDisabled(error);
        throw error;
      }

  **Breaking — `resolveEmbedderConfig(settings, channelId, credentials)`.** It returned the
  empty config, which every caller reads as "LLM search is not configured", for an absent
  `credentials` module as well as for an unset reference. It now rejects with
  `ModuleDisabledError` for the first and still returns the empty config for the second.

  **Breaking — `LlmProviderFactory.capability()` and `.resolve()`.** `capability()` reported
  `not_configured` and `resolve()` threw `AssistantNotConfigured` when `credentials` was
  absent, sending the operator to configure a credential that was already configured. Both now
  let `ModuleDisabledError` through.

  **Breaking — `DeliveryConfigService.remove(productFeedId)`.** The credential cleanup after
  the configuration delete absorbed everything. It now rejects with `ModuleDisabledError` when
  `credentials` is absent — the configuration row is gone and its secret is not, and a retry
  cannot reach the secret because the code that named it went with the row. A credential that
  is merely already gone is still tolerated.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-pim-pimcore` is a rename with no API surface: one file-scoped `worker`
  binding becomes `deliveryWorker`.

### Minor Changes

- 661e80d: Fourteen new packages: the **second** batch of modules to leave `backend/src/modules/`
  (feature 080, T040b). Five moved one at a time, then ten together; these fourteen are the
  same shape as the ten, and the properties below hold fourteen times over.

  **One changeset, not fourteen**, for the reason batch one gives: a changeset is written for
  the consumer of a package, and a package that did not exist a moment ago has no upgrader to
  instruct. What genuinely differs per package is its layer inventory, and that is the table.

  Every subpath is compiled output (D-164); none has a root wildcard; each package's `.` is
  its `manifest.ts`, where the generated manifest index reads the module's identity, its
  `dependencies`, its permission codes, its command-palette actions, its settings and its
  activation control.

  | Package                                     | Subpaths                         | Entities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Migrations | Ships          |

  **`./backend` publishes `registerModule(ctx)` and an `entities` array, and no entity class by
  name** (D-168) — type-only exports included, which this batch measured rather than assumed:
  two packages published their entities' row types so the dev seed could name them, and
  `module-package-entity-surface.test.ts` refused both, in as many words — _"that is the one
  thing that makes a foreign module's `import type { … }` compile"_. The exports are gone and
  the seed takes each class off the published array by name.

  **One of the fourteen owns no table and says so with an empty array rather than by
  omission.** `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels` exports `entities: readonly never[] = []`.
  The distinction is not cosmetic: the platform's package loader answers a _missing_ export
  with `[]`, so "this module has no table" and "somebody forgot the array" would otherwise
  arrive as one silence, whose only symptom is a query against a table nobody created.

  **One package publishes a type on `./backend` that is not an entity**, and it is there
  because a composition root has to name a contribution it supplies:
  `@endora-commerce/mod-shopping-lists` re-exports `ShoppingListService`. A root cannot reach
  a package's internal file — `rootDir` makes a relative specifier into `packages/` TS6059
  even for an `import type` — so a contribution shape has to be on a published subpath or it
  is unnameable.

  **Two packages declare a `@fastify/*` dependency nothing imports.**
  `@endora-commerce/mod-mfa` peers on `@fastify/cookie` and `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa` on
  `@fastify/multipart`, because `reply.setCookie`, `request.isMultipart()` and
  `request.file()` are declaration-merging augmentations rather than imports. Inside the
  application those arrived ambiently through the host's own dependency; a package compiles
  against its own manifest, where an unnamed dependency does not exist. Both write
  `import type {} from '@fastify/…'`, which is type-only: the plugin is still the host's to
  register.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter` and `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa` also carry a companion
  `@types/*` in `devDependencies`** — `@types/nodemailer` and `@types/web-push` — which the
  manifest generator now derives. Nothing imports a `@types` package; the compiler finds it
  through `node_modules/@types`, which inside a package is the package's own declaration, so
  a module importing a JS-only library did not build until this landed.

### Patch Changes

- 6f5687c: These four packages now declare a `test` script and ship a `vitest.config.ts`, so the unit
  tests they already carried beside their sources are collected and run.

  They were not. `specs/deferred-defects.md`'s _"Co-located tests inside a module package run
  nowhere"_ is the entry this closes: no vitest configuration included `packages/**` and no
  module package declared a test command, so fifteen files across these four packages were
  collected by no run, reported by no job and counted in no total. They were not failing —
  as far as the pipeline was concerned they did not exist, which in review reads as coverage.
  All fifteen pass on first collection: 103 tests, and the CI job that will now run them,
  `test:frontend`, goes from 229 files / 1240 tests to 244 / 1343.

  **If you consume one of these packages**, nothing you import changes: `files` still ships
  `dist` and `i18n`, `tsconfig.build.json` still roots the emit at `src/`, and the test files
  and the configuration are in neither. The only difference is that `pnpm test` inside the
  package now does something.

  **If you write a module package**, two rules now hold and are enforced rather than
  documented:
  - The generated `test` script is a bare `vitest run` — never `--passWithNoTests`. Measured
    on vitest 2.1.9 over a package with no test file, bare `run` exits 1 with _"No test files
    found"_ and the flag turns that into 0. A package that declares a runner and collects
    nothing must fail, or the repair reproduces the defect it fixes.
  - `manifests:generate` and `manifests:check` **refuse** a package that holds a test file and
    declares no `vitest.config.ts`, naming the file. That is what stops the gap reopening
    silently for the next package.

  A package's `vitest.config.ts` must `mergeConfig` the repository root's
  `vitest.config.base.ts`: that is where issue #255's foreign-workspace-link refusal lives,
  and a configuration that skips it can execute another checkout's sources while reporting on
  this branch.

- 3786732: Error-code ownership: the rest of Tier A is declared by the modules that own its nouns.

  `manifest.errorCodes` gains six codes on `@endora-commerce/mod-prompt-actions`
  (`ASSISTANT_*`, `PROMPT_*`), five on `@endora-commerce/mod-custom-fields` (`CUSTOM_FIELD_*`),
  two on `@endora-commerce/mod-customers` (`CUSTOMER_ADDRESS_NOT_FOUND`,
  `REGISTRATION_REQUIRES_ORGANIZATION`), two on `@endora-commerce/mod-shopping-lists`
  (`SHOPPING_LIST_*`), one on `@endora-commerce/mod-price-lists` (`PRICE_LIST_NOT_FOUND`) and one
  on `@endora-commerce/mod-transactional-emails` (`TRANSACTIONAL_EMAIL_NOT_DEACTIVATABLE`);
  `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n` drops the same seventeen from its own declaration, which is what
  decides where the error envelope looks for a sentence (D-129's remaining sweep, MR 3 of eight;
  D-121 tiers T1 and T2; `specs/090-module-owned-error-codes/d129-sweep.md`).

  For a consumer this changes which bundle answers for those codes. No wire shape moves —
  `error.code` is unchanged — and no sentence is relocated: none of the seventeen had a
  translation in `en` or `pl` in any bundle. Writing one of those sentences is now a change to the
  owning module's own `i18n/{en,pl}.json` rather than to the platform's.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-shopping-lists` gains an `i18n` bundle it never had, declared as
  `i18n: { bundlesDir: 'i18n' }` and shipped in `files`. It holds the two `SHOPPING_LIST_*`
  sentences in both languages, which is an operator- and buyer-visible improvement: a Polish
  reader refused a delete of the default or the last shopping list now reads Polish prose instead
  of the English the raise site carries.

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.
