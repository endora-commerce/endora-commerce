# @endora-commerce/mod-cms

## 0.7.0

### Major Changes

- 316f44b: `@endora-commerce/admin-kit` publishes four generic members that sat under a module's
  admin directory and were rendered from another's (feature 091, P8).

  **`./components` gains `ContentLanguageTabs` and `ScopePicker`.**
  - `ContentLanguageTabs({ languages, activeLanguage, onChange })` — a tab strip over
    content language codes. Its props type is `ContentLanguageTabsProps`.
  - `ScopePicker({ value, onChange })` — sales channels and the content languages inside
    them. Its props type is `ScopePickerProps` and its value type is **`ScopePickerValue`**,
    which is `CmsScopeValue` renamed: `{ salesChannelIds: string[]; languages: string[] }`,
    field for field. A consumer importing `CmsScopeValue` from `mod-cms`' admin code renames
    the type and changes nothing else.
  - `listScopeSalesChannels(pageSize?)` and `fetchScopeSalesChannel(code)` come with it. The
    picker called `sales_channels`' admin API client; it now builds both `GET`s from the
    published `apiClient` and the contract's own `SalesChannelListResponse` /
    `SalesChannelDetail`, so the kit holds no module code.

  **`./ui` gains `Section`** — `Section({ title, action?, className?, children })` and
  `SectionProps`. A heading, an optional action beside it and a slot; it is a layout
  primitive, which is why it is here and not on `./components`.

  **`./lib` gains the three invoice e-mail-outcome helpers** — `invoiceEmailNotSentReason`,
  `sendInvoiceEmailMessage` and `issueInvoiceNotice`, plus the `Translate` type they take.
  Signatures are unchanged: each still receives the caller's scope-bound `t`.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-cms`' bundle loses six keys** and `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`'s
  gains them under new names, because the two components now render out of `core` (ruling
  R-1: a translation namespace is module knowledge). None of the six had another reader.

  | gone from `mod-cms`      | arrives in `mod-i18n`           |
  | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
  | `languageTabs.empty`     | `contentLanguageTabs.empty`     |
  | `languageTabs.ariaLabel` | `contentLanguageTabs.ariaLabel` |
  | `scope.title`            | `scopePicker.title`             |
  | `fields.languages`       | `scopePicker.languages`         |
  | `scope.selectChannel`    | `scopePicker.selectChannel`     |
  | `scope.loadingLanguages` | `scopePicker.loadingLanguages`  |

  Every value is carried across unchanged in both shipped languages. **A consumer that
  supplies its own bundle has to move all six**: a key left in the `cms` scope does not fail
  to compile and does not 404 — it renders `core.scopePicker.title` into the operator's screen
  as a label.

  The invoice e-mail helpers move no key. All twelve they read —
  `invoices.emailNotSent.<reason>` (seven), `invoices.emailSent`,
  `invoices.emailNotSentNotice` and three `orderDetail.issueInvoice.*` — were already
  `mod-i18n`'s in both languages and in neither `mod-invoices`' bundle nor `mod-orders`'.

- 09df879: The shared admin page-builder chrome's copy moves out of `mod-cms`' bundle and into
  `mod-i18n`'s, which the admin serves under the synthetic `core` scope (feature 091 P5a;
  ruling R-1: a translation namespace is module knowledge, and this copy is nobody's).

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-cms`' bundle loses 33 keys**, every one of them under
  `pageBuilder.*` and every one of them read only by `PageBuilderHeaderActions.tsx` — the
  header shell, the template actions and the header tools that `cms`, `invoices` and the
  e-mail builder all render. The blocks that moved whole are
  `pageBuilder.saveAsTemplate.*` (9), `pageBuilder.applyTemplate.*` (9),
  `pageBuilder.copyLanguage.*` (8, minus `emptySource`), `pageBuilder.clearCanvas.*` (5) and
  `pageBuilder.fullscreen.*` (2). The bundle keeps its other 65 `pageBuilder.*` keys —
  `components.*`, `categories.*`, `drawer.*`, `copyLanguage.emptySource` and the rest — which
  belong to `cms`' own screens, and it keeps `common.saving`, `fields.name` and `fields.code`,
  which its editors read.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-i18n` gains those 33 plus three new `common.*` entries**:
  `common.state.saving`, `common.field.name` and `common.field.code`. They are additions
  rather than moves because `cms` reads its own copies of the same three concepts from its own
  screens; no existing `core` key carried those values.

  **What a consumer that supplies its own bundle has to do:** move the 33 `pageBuilder.*` keys
  from the `cms` scope into `core`, and add the three `common.*` entries. A key left behind
  does not fail to compile and does not 404 — it renders `core.pageBuilder.clearCanvas.button`
  into the operator's screen as a label.

  `common.state.saving` is `"Saving…"` / `"Zapisywanie…"`, with the typographic ellipsis its
  `common.state.loading` sibling uses, where `cms`' own `common.saving` is `"Saving..."`. That
  is the one rendered character this release changes.

### Minor Changes

- 59c59c6: `cms` and `blog` ship their admin screens, and `cms` publishes its page-builder canvas.

  **Two packages' `./admin` subpath is new, and `@endora-commerce/mod-cms` gains a second UI
  subpath.** Eighteen routes and seven sidebar entries between them, at the paths the
  hand-written host registrations carried, plus `./admin-ui` on `cms` for the one component
  another module renders. The exported symbol on `./admin` is the same one every other module
  package uses — `contributions`, an `AdminContributions` object, and nothing else.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-cms` — **new `./admin` subpath**, exporting `contributions`. Eleven
    routes: `/cms` and `/cms/pages` (the landing route) on `cms.read`, `/cms/pages/:id`,
    `/cms/blocks`, `/cms/blocks/:id`, `/cms/templates`, `/cms/templates/:id` and `/cms/hooks`
    on `cms.read`, and `/cms/pages/new`, `/cms/blocks/new` and `/cms/templates/new` on
    **`cms.write`**. `/cms` is a second declaration of the page list rather than a redirect,
    because a redirect would be the consuming application's route and not this module's. Four
    sidebar rows, in the `content` section at weights 100 to 400.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-blog` — **new `./admin` subpath**, exporting `contributions`. Seven
    routes: `/blog/posts` (the landing route), `/blog/posts/:id`, `/blog/categories`,
    `/blog/categories/:id` and `/blog/tags` on `blog.read`, and `/blog/posts/new` and
    `/blog/categories/new` on **`blog.write`**. Three sidebar rows, in the `content` section at
    weights 600 to 800.

  **The five create routes take the write code, and that is a behaviour change for a consumer
  rendering these routes.** Each create screen exists to write — `POST /api/v1/admin/cms/pages`
  and its four siblings enforce the write code — and each module's own palette action
  (`new-page`, `new-post`) already advertised that code. The routes were ungated while they
  belonged to the admin application, so a read-only operator could open a form whose save then
  refused. The five create controls are gated on the same code in this release — the _New page_,
  _New block_, _New template_, _New post_ and _New category_ buttons and the category tree's
  _+ Child_ — so the dead end is closed at both ends. `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels`
  ships the identical split for `/sales-channels/new` and `@endora-commerce/mod-credentials` for
  `/credentials/new`.

  **`CategoryTreeNode` takes a new required prop.** It is not exported from any subpath, so this
  affects nobody outside the package; it is recorded because the prop is `canCreate: boolean`
  and required rather than optional — a caller that forgets it does not compile, which is the
  direction a permission gate has to fail in.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-cms` — new `./admin-ui` subpath, exporting `PageBuilderEditor` and the
  `PageBuilderData` type.** This is the Puck canvas the CMS page, block and template editors
  render and that `@endora-commerce/mod-blog`'s post and category editors render too. Its props
  are `data` in and `onChange` back, so the consumer decides that it appears — a published
  component rather than something the owner contributes to a place of its own choosing. It is
  not in `@endora-commerce/admin-kit` because it is a `@measured/puck` host and the kit is what
  every module's admin layer compiles against, and not in
  `@endora-commerce/page-builder-admin` because it calls this module's API client, reads this
  module's translation namespace and lays the CMS page container out — that package holds the
  builder chrome that names no module at all.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-blog` gains `@endora-commerce/mod-cms` as a peer dependency**, which
  is what a published component costs: the reach survives into the emitted JavaScript, so a
  consumer bundling `blog`'s admin layer must resolve `cms`. It is not a `dependency` — a module
  reaches another through a port declared in its manifest, never through npm — and it is not
  optional. A consumer that installs `@endora-commerce/mod-blog` without `@endora-commerce/mod-cms`
  will fail to resolve `@endora-commerce/mod-cms/admin-ui` at bundle time. There is no runtime
  half to worry about: `blog`'s module manifest already declares `cms` in its `dependencies`, so
  a platform where `cms` is absent or switched off is one where `blog` cannot be activated
  either.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-cms` and `@endora-commerce/mod-blog` ship new i18n keys, and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n` loses seven.** `nav.cmsPages.label`, `nav.cmsBlocks.label`,
  `nav.cmsTemplates.label`, `nav.cmsHooks.label`, `nav.blogPosts.label`,
  `nav.blogCategories.label` and `nav.blogTags.label` are in the two modules' own
  `i18n/{en,pl}.json`; `appShell.nav.cmsPages`, `appShell.nav.cmsBlocks`,
  `appShell.nav.cmsTemplates`, `appShell.nav.cmsHooks`, `appShell.nav.blogPosts`,
  `appShell.nav.blogCategories` and `appShell.nav.blogTags` are removed from the shared bundle
  in both shipped languages, nothing rendering them any more. **A consumer resolving one of
  those seven keys out of the `core` namespace will get a raw key**; each has a
  module-namespaced replacement above.

  **Neither module declares a new palette action, and neither loses one.** `cms` has declared
  `new-page` and `blog` `new-post` all along, and the admin application's own palette table
  never carried a hand-written row for either — so unlike batches 10, 13 and 14 there was
  nothing to convert.

- 5fc0550: A stored Page Builder block whose owning module is absent now degrades to a visible,
  data-preserving placeholder instead of vanishing.

  **`@endora-commerce/cms-components`** gains `withMissingBlockPlaceholders(config, storedNames)`.
  Give it a Puck `Config` and the block names a stored document carries, and every name the
  config cannot render comes back keyed to a placeholder that names the block and its owning
  module. It adds no category entry: a degraded block stays editable where it already is and is
  insertable by nobody.

  ```diff
   const filtered = filterConfigByContext(merged, context);
  +const degraded = withMissingBlockPlaceholders(filtered, [...countBlockNames(doc).keys()]);
  ```

  It takes names rather than the document deliberately — a React caller needs a stable memo key,
  and a keystroke inside a text block moves the document without moving its names.

  **`makeMissingComponentConfig` gains a third, optional argument**, `{ visible?: boolean }`.
  Existing calls are unchanged: omitting it keeps the placeholder deciding for itself from the
  `?cms_admin=1` preview parameter, which is right for a customer-facing surface. Pass
  `{ visible: true }` on an editing surface, where the operator has to be told which module the
  block is waiting on.

  **`@endora-commerce/page-builder-core`** exports `countBlockNames`, `mapBlockNames`,
  `renameBlockNames` and their two types from the package root. They were reachable only through
  the `./migration` subpath, which still exports them, so no existing import changes. What that
  subpath quarantines is the frozen rename map; the walk itself is a generic "which node `type`
  values does this document hold" and is now needed at runtime.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-cms`**'s `PageBuilderEditor` applies both. Its canvas previously
  rendered nothing at all for a block whose owner had been switched off — indistinguishable
  from a block somebody had deleted — because the placeholder it merged was built only for
  names the backend descriptor declares, and a switched-off module's blocks are filtered out
  of that descriptor. Every placeholder it did merge rendered an empty `<span>`, the
  `?cms_admin=1` parameter being set by nothing.

- f66359f: The stored Page Builder block names are namespaced, once, by five migrations.

  Each of the five table-owning modules rewrites **its own** columns — `cms` three, `blog`
  two, `transactional_emails` three, `newsletter` two, `invoices` one — with a recursive
  `pg_temp` function generated from `FROZEN_BLOCK_RENAMES`. A migration belongs to the module
  that owns the **table**, never to the module that owns the new name, so no new manifest
  `dependencies` edge arises: a block name is a string value inside a JSONB document, not a
  foreign key.

  The rewrite is **structural**: it replaces the value of a `type` property in a node position
  and nothing else. Twelve of the 74 names are ordinary English words (`Row`, `Text`, `Image`,
  `Map`, `Button`, …) that occur throughout shop content, so a textual substitution would
  corrupt a `RawHtml` block's markup and every `alt` attribute in the shop.

  It is **idempotent by construction** — every key of the map is bare and every value is
  dotted, so a second run finds nothing — and it **cannot fail on its input**: a name the map
  does not hold is left byte-identical and reported, never quarantined. `down()` applies the
  inverse over the identical walk.

  `cms` gains an operator command for the pre-flight:

  ```
  pnpm --filter backend run cli -- cms block-names
  ```

  Read-only, across all eleven columns, classifying every stored name as _will be renamed →
  new name_, _already namespaced_ or _unrecognised_. Run it before upgrading, resolve or accept
  the unrecognised set, take a backup, upgrade, and run it again: every _will be renamed_
  becomes _already namespaced_ and the unrecognised set is unchanged.

  `catalog`, `orders` and `ksef` are patch-bumped because their block declarations are now what
  the registry serves — the eight `catalog` blocks, the eight `orders` ones and
  `ksef.InvoiceSection` were previously registered as `cms`' and `invoices`'.

- b0df9c1: A shop can tell crawlers its CMS pages exist, and an operator is told where a page will live.

  **`@endora-commerce/contracts`** gains four names, all additive:
  - `cmsPageIndexEntrySchema` / `CmsPageIndexEntry` and `cmsPageIndexResponseSchema` /
    `CmsPageIndexResponse` — `{ pages: [{ slug, updatedAt }] }`, the shape of
    `GET /api/v1/cms/pages/by-channel`. `slug` is the **per-channel** slug from
    `cms_page_sales_channels`, never `cms_pages.slug`: the address is per channel
    (Constitution XII) and the page row's own column is one value shared by all of them.
  - `cmsReservedSegmentsResponseSchema` / `CmsReservedSegmentsResponse` — the deployment's
    reserved first path segments, normalised.
  - `firstSlugSegment(slug)` — the first path segment of a CMS page slug, lowercased.
    `cmsSlugRe` permits `/`, so `pomoc/dostawa` is one page and its first segment is `pomoc`.
    It is published because **two** programs ask that question and must agree: the backend
    refusing a save, and the page editor warning while an operator types.
  - `ERROR_CODES.CMS_SLUG_RESERVED`.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-cms`** gains two endpoints, a Setting and a refusal:

  ```
  GET /api/v1/cms/pages/by-channel            # storefront, channel-scoped, published-only
  GET /api/v1/admin/cms/pages/reserved-segments   # admin, `cms.read`
  ```

  The first is what a sitemap is built from. Until now the reference storefront advertised **no
  CMS URL to any crawler at all** — its `SITEMAP_DYNAMIC_ROUTES` named the route _pattern_, which
  is a declaration for the indexability check's reconciliation and says nothing about the rows
  behind it. Both routes are registered inside the module's existing `ctx.routes` seam, so both
  answer `503 MODULE_DISABLED` while `cms` is switched off and the storefront's sitemap then
  advertises no CMS URL and still serves.

  The Setting is `cms.reserved_slug_segments` — `valueType: 'json'`, `defaultValue: []`, in the
  existing `cms` group. A CMS page is served at the storefront root, `/{slug}`, so a page slugged
  `cart` saves, publishes and is never shown: a root catch-all is Next's lowest-priority match and
  the storefront's own `/cart` wins. **Nothing in this change creates that precedence**; what it
  removes is the silence. `CmsPageService.create` and `.patch` refuse a slug whose first segment
  the deployment reserves, with `409 CMS_SLUG_RESERVED` carrying `details.segment`, and the page
  editor reads the same value and warns inline while the operator types. A patch that writes no
  slug is not refused, so a page whose slug predates the reserved set stays editable.

  **The default is empty and that is not a gap.** The set is a fact about a _storefront's route
  table_; a headless backend serves storefronts it did not build, so a list shipped inside `cms`
  would be a derived fact about a consumer written into the owner. The reference storefront
  publishes its own as `RESERVED_TOP_LEVEL_SEGMENTS` in `storefront/app/reserved-segments.ts`,
  reconciled against its route tree in both directions by `check:storefront-indexability`; a
  deployment copies its value from there.

  Nothing is removed and no existing shape changes.

- 661e80d: Fourteen new packages: the **second** batch of modules to leave `backend/src/modules/`
  (feature 080, T040b). Five moved one at a time, then ten together; these fourteen are the
  same shape as the ten, and the properties below hold fourteen times over.

  **One changeset, not fourteen**, for the reason batch one gives: a changeset is written for
  the consumer of a package, and a package that did not exist a moment ago has no upgrader to
  instruct. What genuinely differs per package is its layer inventory, and that is the table.

  Every subpath is compiled output (D-164); none has a root wildcard; each package's `.` is
  its `manifest.ts`, where the generated manifest index reads the module's identity, its
  `dependencies`, its permission codes, its command-palette actions, its settings and its
  activation control.

  **`./backend` publishes `registerModule(ctx)` and an `entities` array, and no entity class by
  name** (D-168) — type-only exports included, which this batch measured rather than assumed:
  two packages published their entities' row types so the dev seed could name them, and
  `module-package-entity-surface.test.ts` refused both, in as many words — _"that is the one
  thing that makes a foreign module's `import type { … }` compile"_. The exports are gone and
  the seed takes each class off the published array by name.

  **One of the fourteen owns no table and says so with an empty array rather than by
  omission.** `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels` exports `entities: readonly never[] = []`.
  The distinction is not cosmetic: the platform's package loader answers a _missing_ export
  with `[]`, so "this module has no table" and "somebody forgot the array" would otherwise
  arrive as one silence, whose only symptom is a query against a table nobody created.

  **One package publishes a type on `./backend` that is not an entity**, and it is there
  because a composition root has to name a contribution it supplies:
  `@endora-commerce/mod-shopping-lists` re-exports `ShoppingListService`. A root cannot reach
  a package's internal file — `rootDir` makes a relative specifier into `packages/` TS6059
  even for an `import type` — so a contribution shape has to be on a published subpath or it
  is unnameable.

  **Two packages declare a `@fastify/*` dependency nothing imports.**
  `@endora-commerce/mod-mfa` peers on `@fastify/cookie` and `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa` on
  `@fastify/multipart`, because `reply.setCookie`, `request.isMultipart()` and
  `request.file()` are declaration-merging augmentations rather than imports. Inside the
  application those arrived ambiently through the host's own dependency; a package compiles
  against its own manifest, where an unnamed dependency does not exist. Both write
  `import type {} from '@fastify/…'`, which is type-only: the plugin is still the host's to
  register.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter` and `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa` also carry a companion
  `@types/*` in `devDependencies`** — `@types/nodemailer` and `@types/web-push` — which the
  manifest generator now derives. Nothing imports a `@types` package; the compiler finds it
  through `node_modules/@types`, which inside a package is the package's own declaration, so
  a module importing a JS-only library did not build until this landed.

- 1f07b01: The fifteen `pageBuilder.colorPalette.*` strings move from `mod-cms`' bundle into
  `mod-i18n`'s, in both shipped languages (feature 091, P5b — the remedy P5a applied to the
  other thirty-three chrome keys, arriving for the one chrome file P5a's set did not include).

  `ColorPaletteModal` is the shared page-builder chrome's, not `cms`' screen: `cms`,
  `invoices` and the e-mail builder all render it, and it now ships in
  `@endora-commerce/page-builder-admin`. A package cannot depend on one module's bundle for
  strings three modules read, and a namespace is resolved at runtime by string — so a key the
  namespace does not carry renders `cms.pageBuilder.colorPalette.title` into the operator's
  screen instead of failing. The keys therefore live where the reader does, which for chrome
  is the synthetic `core` scope `mod-i18n` serves.

  **If you ship a translation override** keyed `cms.pageBuilder.colorPalette.*`, re-key it to
  `core.pageBuilder.colorPalette.*`. The fifteen keys, their values and both languages are
  otherwise unchanged; no other `cms` key moves, and the other sixty-five `pageBuilder.*` keys
  in `mod-cms`' bundle are its own screens' and stay.

- afedd32: Six modules declare the Page Builder blocks they own — all 74 of them.

  Each package's exported `manifest` gains `blocks` and `blockCategories`, and each
  ships the `blocks.<local>.label`, `blocks.<local>.description` and
  `blocks.category.<key>` entries for them in `i18n/en.json` and `i18n/pl.json`:

  | Package                    | Blocks              | Category declarations  |
  | -------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
  | `mod-cms`                  | 30                  | 8 CMS sections         |
  | `mod-catalog`              | 8 (5 CMS, 3 e-mail) | 2                      |
  | `mod-orders`               | 8 e-mail            | 1 (`order`)            |
  | `mod-transactional-emails` | 17 e-mail           | 4                      |
  | `mod-invoices`             | 10 invoice          | 1 (`invoice`)          |
  | `mod-ksef`                 | 1 invoice           | 1 (`invoice`, joining) |

  **Nothing reads these declarations yet.** The Page Builder registry is still
  populated from the single hand-written `register('cms', …)` call, the three Puck
  configs are still keyed by the bare names, and no stored document changes. Read
  the block `name`s as the names those blocks will have, not as names anything
  resolves today.

  Two `(key, context)` sections are declared by two modules each and **merge**:
  the e-mail `content` section (`mod-transactional-emails` names it,
  `mod-catalog` joins) and the `invoice` section (`mod-invoices` names it,
  `mod-ksef` joins). A joining declaration carries its own `titleKey` and omits
  `weight` and `visible`, so it cannot take a presentation its author did not
  intend to take while still being able to title the section on its own when the
  namer is switched off.

  Three sections change owner or gain a member, which is the point of the exercise
  rather than a side effect: the CMS `catalog` section is `mod-catalog`'s (`cms`
  hand-writes it and owns no block in it); the e-mail `order` section is
  `mod-orders`'; `cms.InsertTemplate` and `transactional_emails.EmailInsertTemplate`
  gain a section, having had none; and `transactional_emails.EmailColumn` moves into
  a new hidden `internal` section.

  `mod-cms`' bundles rename one key: `pageBuilder.categories._internal` becomes
  `pageBuilder.categories.internal`, following the category key in
  `@endora-commerce/cms-components`. The rendered title is unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- b8bd8c7: `cms` declares the ten error codes it owns.

  `manifest.ts` gains an `errorCodes` array — feature 090 Phase 3
  (`specs/090-module-owned-error-codes/`). Nothing the package exports changes
  shape. The observable difference for a consumer is that this module's error
  sentences are now routed by its own declaration rather than only by the prefix
  chain in `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`, which continues to answer identically for
  every one of them: the list is the chain's own answer, copied verbatim from the
  frozen capture, and is asserted equal to it in both directions.

  `CMS_LANGUAGE_NOT_IN_CHANNEL_SCOPE` is among them despite naming two other
  modules' nouns — it is this module's refusal, raised twice in
  `cms-page-service.ts` — and `CMS_REFERENCED` is the cross-entity reference guard
  for pages, blocks and templates rather than a narrowing of `assets_library`'s
  `ASSET_REFERENCED`. Going the other way, the seven raises this module makes of
  `VERSION_CONFLICT` and `VALIDATION_FAILED` are the platform's codes and are not
  declared here.

  All ten already carry a written sentence in both `en` and `pl` in this package's
  own `i18n/` bundles, so no sentence moves and none is added. No `tokens`: none
  of the 32 raises of these codes passes a `details.code` discriminator.

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.
