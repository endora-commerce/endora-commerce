## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 8f61a6b: Every published package now ships its own `LICENSE` and `README.md`.

  npm force-includes a file named `LICENSE` into the tarball exactly as it does `README.md`,
  whatever `files` says, so the text has to be in the package directory and not only at the
  repository root — `LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md` states that rule and, until this release, no package
  obeyed it. Measured on `master`: **0** of the 82 publishable packages carried a `LICENSE` and
  **14** carried a `README.md`, so every tarball shipped without licence text and 68 registry
  pages would have rendered empty.

  Both files are **generated**, by `pnpm --filter backend run manifests:generate`, and refused
  when stale by `manifests:check` in the `quality` job:
  - the `LICENSE` is the repository's root `LICENSE`, copied verbatim — the same single source
    the `license: MIT` field is already rendered from. A package that declares a licence of its
    own in the `SEE LICENSE IN <file>` form is skipped and keeps the file it names.
  - the `README.md` is rendered from what the package's own manifest declares: its description,
    its module id where it has one, every published subpath with what that layer holds, its peer
    dependencies with the optional ones marked, the locales its `i18n/` carries and what the
    tarball ships. A `README.md` **without** the generated marker on its first line is a human's
    and is never rewritten — the fourteen that existed are untouched.

  Five module packages also get their npm description back. `@endora-commerce/mod-blog`,
  `mod-credit-limits`, `mod-dhl-parcel`, `mod-google-analytics` and `mod-quote-requests` carried
  the note written when they were moved out of `backend/src/modules` — _"the first module to
  leave backend/src/modules … the manifest id stays identity of record"_ — as the sentence a
  registry shows under the package name. Each now carries the sentence its own module manifest
  declares, which is where `descriptionFor` seeds one from in the first place.

  No API changes, no new dependency, no behaviour change: what moves is what the tarball carries
  and what a package page says.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 0eeb9b5: Require Node >= 22.18.0.

  The previous floor was 22.17.0, which MikroORM 7 sets. 22.18.0 is the first release that
  strips TypeScript types without a flag, and that is what loads a deployment's overlay module:
  in a scaffolded instance `apps/` is outside every compiled member, so the unit the platform
  `import()`s is the client's own `.ts`. On 22.17.x that import throws
  `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` and the process dies before it listens. Emitting a `.js` beside
  the client's source was measured and refused — the overlay loader resolves `.js` before `.ts`
  while the divergence derivation admits both, so the sibling doubles every seam site in the
  report.

  Derived by probing 22.17.0, 22.17.1, 22.18.0 and 22.19.0 against a `.ts` module imported with
  no flag; 22.18.0 is the lowest that loads it.

  If you run 22.17.x, upgrade to 22.18 or later. Nothing else in these packages changed.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- e27bf6c: Every package that ships scannable UI now publishes its own Tailwind `@source`
  declarations at a new `./tailwind.css` subpath.

  A host compiling this package's utility classes no longer has to know where the
  package's sources are. Import the subpath from the stylesheet that builds your
  admin, and the package names its own layers:

  ```css
  @import 'tailwindcss';
  @import '@endora-commerce/mod-blog/tailwind.css';
  ```

  `@source` resolves relative to the stylesheet that declares it, so the paths hold
  wherever the package is installed. The file is generated from the package's layer
  inventory, ships in the tarball beside `package.json`, and its `dist` line is the one
  that matters to you — the `src` line beside it is inert in a published package and
  exists so that a checkout of this repository keeps scanning source in `dev`.

  **Nothing is removed or renamed**: every existing subpath resolves exactly as before.
  What is new is the obligation on the _host_ side, and it is a build error rather than a
  silent one. Before this, a host reached these packages with a glob over the monorepo
  (`@source "../../packages/**"`), which named a directory no installed tree has —
  and Tailwind reports nothing at all about a source that matches nothing, so such a host
  built green and rendered every screen unstyled. A host that now names a package that is
  not installed gets `Can't resolve`, and one whose tarball omits the file gets
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.

  `@endora-commerce/cms-components` deliberately does **not** publish this subpath. It
  ships a finished, prefixed stylesheet at `./styles.css` and must not also be scanned by
  its host.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 43e1968: `price_lists`, `quick_order`, `inventory` and `pim_ergonode` ship their admin screens, and
  four icon names join the allowlist.

  **Four packages' `./admin` subpath gains `routes` and `nav`.** All four already exported
  `contributions` from `@endora-commerce/mod-<id>/admin` with a `zones` array and nothing else;
  each now declares its screens there too, at the paths and codes the hand-written host
  registrations carried. Sixteen routes and nine sidebar entries between them. The exported
  symbol is unchanged — `contributions`, an `AdminContributions` object, and nothing else — so a
  consumer already reading the zones needs no edit; what is new is that the same object now
  answers for the screens.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-price-lists` — `/price-lists` (the landing route),
    `/price-lists/display-modes` and `/price-lists/:id`, all on `price_lists:read`, which is the
    code the module's single `readGate` enforces on every `GET` behind them; each screen keeps
    gating its own saves on `price_lists:write` inside itself. One sidebar row, in the `pricing`
    section at weight 100. The display-mode screen is reached from a button on the roster and the
    detail screen from the roster itself, so neither has a row of its own.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-quick-order` — `/orders/quick-order` on `orders:write`, the code both
    `POST`s behind the screen enforce; there is no `quick_order:*` permission in the platform at
    all. **No sidebar row**, which is the host table's own decision kept: quick order is the
    other way of getting lines into one order, reached from the `order.entry.tabs` strip this
    package already contributes into.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-inventory` — seven routes: `/inventory` (the landing route),
    `/inventory/low-stock`, `/inventory/notifications`, `/warehouses`, `/warehouses/new` and
    `/warehouses/:id` on `inventory:read`, and `/inventory/import` on `inventory:write`, the
    code its `POST` enforces. Five sidebar rows in the `inventory` section at weights 100 to 500,
    the order the host table had. Both of this module's admin surface directories moved: the
    warehouse screens and their client are here too, the sidebar having always attributed
    `/warehouses` to this module.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-pim-ergonode` — `/pim-ergonode` (the landing route),
    `/pim-ergonode/attribute-mappings`, `/pim-ergonode/category-mappings`, `/pim-ergonode/runs`
    and `/pim-ergonode/runs/:runId`, all on `pim_ergonode:read`. One sidebar row, `catalog`,
    weight 250 — between `@endora-commerce/mod-assets-library`'s 200 and
    `@endora-commerce/mod-pim-pimcore`'s 300, which is the placement both of those packages'
    declarations already describe. Its admin client moved with the screens and is now
    `src/admin/api/ergonode-client.ts` beside the protections client P4b split out.

  Route components are dynamic-import factories, so a consumer's bundler emits one chunk per
  screen, and every screen resolves its design system through `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`.

  **`@endora-commerce/contracts` gains four `KnownIconNameSchema` members** — `Warehouse`,
  `TrendingDown`, `Bell` and `PackageOpen`. Additive: no existing member changes, and
  `KnownIconName` widens rather than narrowing, so no consumer that names an icon today stops
  compiling. They are the four glyphs `inventory`'s sidebar rows carried, which the host imported
  from `lucide-react` by hand; a contribution names its icon rather than importing it, so without
  them four rows would have had to degrade to names already on the allowlist.

  **`@endora-commerce/admin-kit` maps the same four names** in `resolveIcon`. A caller passing one
  of them now gets the matching `lucide-react` component instead of the `Sparkles` fallback.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-price-lists` declares its first palette action**, `open-price-lists`,
  targeting `/price-lists` on `price_lists:read`. It replaces a hand-written row in the admin
  shell and carries that row's destination, code and keywords, so an operator's ⌘K answer is
  unchanged; what changes is that the advertisement is now resolved from the manifest against the
  effective enabled-set. `@endora-commerce/mod-inventory` declares no new action: its
  hand-written row was a second copy of `open-inventory` and is simply gone.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-i18n` loses thirteen keys** — the eight `appShell.nav.*` labels the
  four modules' sidebar rows rendered, two `appShell.palette.sub.*` subtitles, and
  `appShell.crumb.importRun` — in both shipped languages. Each moved into the owning module's own
  bundle under a module-relative key (`nav.priceLists.label`, `nav.stockOverview.label`,
  `nav.warehouses.label`, `nav.lowStock.label`, `nav.notifyWhenAvailable.label`,
  `nav.importStock.label`, `nav.pimErgonode.label`), or was retired with the hand-written
  breadcrumb rule that was its only reader. A consumer resolving one of those keys out of the
  shared bundle gets nothing; resolve it in the owning module's namespace instead.

- ad62954: Fourteen more modules become workspace packages (feature 080, T040b batch three):
  `autopay`, `comparisons`, `credentials`, `dictionaries`, `google_tag_manager`,
  `ksef`, `meta_ads`, `paypal`, `payu`, `quick_order`, `search`, `stripe`, `taxes`
  and `tpay`. Each ships `dist` and resolves through its own `exports` map — the
  root for its manifest, `./backend` for `registerModule` plus the `entities`
  array, `./migrations` for its migration classes — exactly as the twenty-nine
  packages before them.

  **For a consumer of `@endora-commerce/mod-ksef`, one export is new and
  load-bearing.** `KsefUnavailableError` is now published by name on `./backend`:

  ```ts
  import { KsefUnavailableError } from '@endora-commerce/mod-ksef/backend';
  ```

  Anything implementing `KsefApiClientPort` — an overlay's client, a test double,
  a second gateway — must throw **that** class for an outage.
  `classifySubmissionError` decides "retry" from `instanceof`, so a caller holding
  a constructor of its own, or the class from a relative import into this
  package's source, gets its outage classified as `UNEXPECTED`: the submission is
  parked for an operator instead of queued for the sweep, silently. There is no
  behaviour change for a caller that already throws the module's own class.

  Nothing else in any of the fourteen changed shape. The move is a relocation:
  same entities, same migrations, same class names, same tables. The committed
  migration registry's `(moduleId, className)` declaration sequence and its
  computed execution sequence are byte-identical to the merge base — 158 entries,
  `declaration=2db29d89…`, `execution=c794685f…` — because packaging changes no
  manifest `dependencies` and the order is a function of those.

- 9b2a43e: Added the `order.entry.tabs` admin zone, and `<RouteTabsZone>` — the renderer that makes a
  zone a tab strip.

  `@endora-commerce/contracts` gains the enum member `'order.entry.tabs'` and the props type
  `OrderEntryTabsZoneProps`, which is empty: the contributions _are_ the tabs, so the mount has
  no identifier to pass. `AdminZonePropsMap` gains the matching entry, so a host writing
  `<RouteTabsZone name="order.entry.tabs" props={{}} />` is type-checked against it exactly as
  an `<AdminZone>` mount is.

  `@endora-commerce/admin-kit` gains two exports:
  - `RouteTabsZone` on `./zones` — `{ name, props, className? }`. It renders the strip chrome
    and delegates the contributions to `<AdminZone>`, so the lazy-component cache, the
    per-contributor error boundary and the `weight` ordering are unchanged. **It renders
    nothing at all when fewer than two contributions survive presence and permission**: one tab
    is not a choice. The floor is a constant rather than a prop, deliberately — two is a
    property of tab strips, and a `minimum` prop would let a caller ask for the thing the rule
    refuses.
  - `RouteTabLink` on `./ui` — `{ to, label }`, the tab a contribution renders. It decides its
    own selected state, because in a contributed strip no component sees the whole set. That
    costs `RouteTabs`' _longest-wins_ tie-break: two contributed tabs whose paths are prefixes
    of one another would both read as selected. `RouteTabs` itself is unchanged and is still
    the primitive to use whenever one component knows every tab.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-orders` gains an `./admin` subpath — its first — contributing the
  _Standard order_ tab at weight 100. `@endora-commerce/mod-quick-order` gains the _Quick
  order_ tab at weight 200. Both are gated on `orders:write`, which is the code their routes
  enforce. Each label now ships in its own module's bundle
  (`orderEntry.tab.standard`, `orderEntry.tab.quick`) instead of the shared `core` one.

  **If you were rendering `OrderEntryTabs` from the admin application**, it is gone. It knew
  both module ids and both routes and belonged to neither module; mount the zone instead:

  ```diff
  -import { OrderEntryTabs } from '@/components/OrderEntryTabs';
  -<OrderEntryTabs />
  +import { RouteTabsZone } from '@endora-commerce/admin-kit/zones';
  +<RouteTabsZone name="order.entry.tabs" props={{}} className="mb-4" />
  ```

- 184fa9f: Two detail-screen zone members, four contributors, and the end of two live component
  duplications.

  `@endora-commerce/contracts` adds two members to `AdminZoneNameSchema`, each with its entry
  in `AdminZonePropsMap`:

  | Member                      | Props                                            | Rendered by                                         |
  | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
  | `organization.detail.after` | `OrganizationDetailZoneProps { organizationId }` | the end of the organization detail screen, **once** |
  | `customer.detail.after`     | `CustomerDetailZoneProps { customerId }`         | the end of the customer detail screen, **once**     |

  `OrganizationDetailZoneProps` and `CustomerDetailZoneProps` are new exported interfaces. The
  second is not an alias of the first: the prop is named for the entity the mount carries, and
  the two members are two places.

  **One mount per screen is a rule, not a layout choice.** Neither member carries a prop that
  could tell two mounts apart, so a second mount of either renders every contribution twice
  and nothing in the renderer can distinguish them.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-quick-order` gains an `./admin` subpath — its first — with two zone
  contributions and `DefaultPreferencesPanel`, which moves into the package. The panel's two
  preference calls are rebuilt from the published `apiClient`; `quick-order-client.ts` stays in
  the admin application, where the on-behalf-of screen still uses it.

  ```tsx
  // Both contributions declare `orders:write`, which is the code every admin
  // route this module owns enforces. There is no `quick_order:*` permission.
  zoneComponent('organization.detail.after', () => import('./zones/OrganizationDefaults.js'), {
    weight: 300,
    requiredPermission: 'orders:write',
  });
  ```

  `@endora-commerce/mod-carts` gains its first zone contribution and a new route,
  `GET /api/v1/admin/organizations/:id/cart-approval-policy`, gated on `customers:manage` and
  answering `cartApprovalPolicyResponseSchema` — the same code and the same shape as the
  `PATCH` that has been there since feature 027. `CartApprovalService` gains `getPolicyByAdmin`.
  The contribution reads its own initial state through that route instead of taking the
  `initialRequiresCartApproval` prop the old panel took, because a zone's props cannot carry a
  value only one of four contributors wants.

  That panel had been imported by nothing, and the copy it rendered was in no bundle under any
  spelling — `t('carts.policy.title')` under the `carts` namespace resolves to
  `bundle['carts']['carts.policy.title']`, which never existed. Ten `policy.*` keys are added to
  this package's own bundle in both shipped languages, and the capability reaches an operator
  for the first time.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-price-lists` and `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels` each gain a
  second contribution over a component they already ship, and each loses its duplicate:
  `DisplayModeOverrideRow` and `EntityChannelMembership` existed twice in the tree for the
  length of the previous release, because the organization detail screen still imported the
  `admin/src` copy. Both copies are gone and nothing imports them.

  **Operator-visible copy change.** The organization detail's pricing card is now
  `price_lists`' own: the screen used to pass `organizations.detail.pricingLabel` and
  `organizations.detail.pricingHint` into a control it does not own and wrap it in a card
  titled `organizations.detail.pricingCard`. A host cannot hand copy to a contributor it does
  not know, so the control renders `priceLists.displayMode.rowLabel` and its own hint, and all
  three host keys are removed from the `core` bundle in both languages. Two further `core` keys
  go with them — `priceLists.linked.displayModeLabel` and `priceLists.linked.displayModeHint`,
  which the previous release left unread.

  No contribution declares a `match`, and each says why in its own file: `match` narrows the
  mounts of one place, and each of these members has one host and one mount. Every zone test
  asserts it absent.

### Patch Changes

- 6f5687c: These four packages now declare a `test` script and ship a `vitest.config.ts`, so the unit
  tests they already carried beside their sources are collected and run.

  They were not. `specs/deferred-defects.md`'s _"Co-located tests inside a module package run
  nowhere"_ is the entry this closes: no vitest configuration included `packages/**` and no
  module package declared a test command, so fifteen files across these four packages were
  collected by no run, reported by no job and counted in no total. They were not failing —
  as far as the pipeline was concerned they did not exist, which in review reads as coverage.
  All fifteen pass on first collection: 103 tests, and the CI job that will now run them,
  `test:frontend`, goes from 229 files / 1240 tests to 244 / 1343.

  **If you consume one of these packages**, nothing you import changes: `files` still ships
  `dist` and `i18n`, `tsconfig.build.json` still roots the emit at `src/`, and the test files
  and the configuration are in neither. The only difference is that `pnpm test` inside the
  package now does something.

  **If you write a module package**, two rules now hold and are enforced rather than
  documented:
  - The generated `test` script is a bare `vitest run` — never `--passWithNoTests`. Measured
    on vitest 2.1.9 over a package with no test file, bare `run` exits 1 with _"No test files
    found"_ and the flag turns that into 0. A package that declares a runner and collects
    nothing must fail, or the repair reproduces the defect it fixes.
  - `manifests:generate` and `manifests:check` **refuse** a package that holds a test file and
    declares no `vitest.config.ts`, naming the file. That is what stops the gap reopening
    silently for the next package.

  A package's `vitest.config.ts` must `mergeConfig` the repository root's
  `vitest.config.base.ts`: that is where issue #255's foreign-workspace-link refusal lives,
  and a configuration that skips it can execute another checkout's sources while reporting on
  this branch.

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.

- 764b379: **`customerFilterCond`'s `allowed-set` arm stops returning `{}`, and the function takes an
  argument.**

  `customerFilterCond()` is now `customerFilterCond(organizationColumn: CustomerOrganizationColumn)`,
  where `CustomerOrganizationColumn` is `'present' | 'absent'` — both exported from
  `@endora-commerce/platform/tenancy`'s `filters` module. Any direct caller must pass one:

  ```ts
  // before
  const where = customerFilterCond();
  // after — `'present'` iff the entity you are filtering carries `organizationId`
  const where = customerFilterCond('absent');
  ```

  `@CustomerScoped()` itself is source-compatible and takes no new argument. It derives the answer
  per query from the ORM's discovered metadata, so an entity that gains an `organizationId` column
  starts being filtered on it with no further change.

  **The behaviour change is confined to the `allowed-set` mode** — the mode a scoped
  (assignment-limited) administrator resolves to. It previously contributed **no predicate at all**
  to any `@CustomerScoped` entity, so such an entity behaved as if it were `@GlobalEntity` for that
  actor. It now contributes `{ organizationId: { $in: allowed } }` when the entity carries the
  column, and a predicate that matches nothing when it does not. `all`, `system` and `single-org`
  are unchanged, and a buyer resolves `single-org`.

  A surface that has already established the caller's authority by other means and reads a
  `@CustomerScoped` entity with no organization column will now read nothing under a scoped
  administrator. Cross that deliberately with `withSystemScope(reason, fn)` after the check that
  establishes the authority; do not catch.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-quick-order`'s `registerQuickOrderAdminRoutes` takes a new required dep,
  `customerAccounts: CustomerAccountReadPort`. It is the tenant boundary of the admin build route:
  `onBehalfOf` names the customer account and organization the built Cart or Quote Request is
  written to, and it arrives in the request body, where no read filter can reach it.
