### Patch Changes

- d6bfea0: `@endora-commerce/contracts` no longer exports InPost's schemas; a carrier integration publishes its own

  **If you import any `inpost*` symbol from `@endora-commerce/contracts`, this release removes it.**
  Twenty-one exports go — `inpostConfigSchema`, `inpostConfigUpdateSchema`,
  `inpostGeowidgetConfigSchema`, `inpostLockerShippingAdapterDataSchema`, `inpostModeSchema`,
  `inpostAdapterKeySchema`, `inpostSendingMethodSchema`, `inpostParcelTemplateSchema`,
  `inpostLabelSizeSchema`, `inpostLabelErrorCodeSchema`, `normalizePolishMobilePhone` and each
  inferred type beside them. They are now on `@endora-commerce/mod-inpost`'s own `./contracts`
  subpath:

  ```diff
  - import { inpostConfigSchema, normalizePolishMobilePhone } from '@endora-commerce/contracts';
  + import { inpostConfigSchema, normalizePolishMobilePhone } from '@endora-commerce/mod-inpost/contracts';
  ```

  **Why, and why it is not an accident of tidying.** `@endora-commerce/contracts` is a free
  package. A schema describing InPost's ShipX API is only usable by an instance that installs the
  InPost module, so shipping it here asked every consumer to carry ~5 300 lines of per-vendor
  contract for integrations most of them will never run — and, once a carrier module is published
  from somewhere else, put the schema and the code it describes under two owners. The module now
  carries both.

  `minor` rather than `major`: no package in this repository leaves `0.x` before the move to public
  npmjs, and in a `0.x` series a minor already takes every caret dependent out of range, which is
  the whole consumer-facing meaning of a break.

  **A new published subpath, `./contracts`, exists on module packages from this release.** It is
  rendered from a `src/contracts/` directory and appears only on a package that has one; nothing
  else in the estate changes shape. `@endora-commerce/mod-inpost` is the first to use it.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-delivery-methods` is a documentation patch, and the reason is the same
  split: its page linked a sibling carrier's page, which is a broken link in every instance that
  does not install that carrier. It now names carrier modules without linking one.

### Patch Changes

- 30c5e6f: `delivery_methods` publishes an install surface, and the two carriers seed themselves through it

  `@endora-commerce/mod-delivery-methods` gains two subpaths, both additive:
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-delivery-methods/ports`** — type-only, declaring `DeliveryMethodSeedApi`,
    `DeliveryMethodSeedDefaults`, `DeliveryMethodSeedRecord` and `DeliveryMethodSeedOutcome`. Every
    method takes the caller's MikroORM `EntityManager` as a required first parameter, which is why the
    interface cannot live in `@endora-commerce/contracts`.
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-delivery-methods/install`** — the runtime half:
    `createDeliveryMethodSeeder()`, on a pure re-export layer (`module-package-layout.md` R11, ruled as
    D-251). `ensureMethodForAdapter(em, adapterKey, defaults)` answers `{ row, created }`;
    `bindToDefaultChannel(em, id)` puts a method in the system-default channel, answers `false` when it
    is already there **or** when the platform has no default channel yet, and is meant to be called
    only when `created === true`; `removeMethodForAdapter(em, code)` is the hard-uninstall half.
    **Not on `./backend`**: a factory there would make one subpath mean either "wiring this module" or
    "seeding a row through the sanctioned surface", and it would hand every consumer most of an import
    graph it never calls — 12 emitted files and 7 external specifiers including the HTTP layer, against
    3 and 4 without it.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-inpost` and `@endora-commerce/mod-dhl-parcel` now seed their two delivery
  methods each from an `installHook` through that surface, and remove them from an `uninstallHook`
  behind `if (!ctx.hard) return;`. Both seed migrations keep their class names and are no-ops: the class
  name is what `mikro_orm_migrations` stores in every database that already ran them, so neither may be
  renamed or deleted. A consumer upgrading across this change sees no row change — the hook matches on
  `code`, finds what the migration wrote and returns it untouched — and a fresh install reaches the
  same rows through the hook alone.

  **Both carriers gain `@endora-commerce/mod-delivery-methods` as a required peer**, and it is a patch
  rather than a minor deliberately: every instance that installs a carrier already installs
  `delivery_methods`, because each carrier's module manifest has declared it in `dependencies` since
  feature 068 and the lifecycle refuses the install without it. The peer states in npm's vocabulary
  what the manifest already required, and pnpm and npm provide a missing peer automatically. Read it
  the other way and the level is a minor.

  Nothing published is removed or narrowed, so `mod-delivery-methods` is a patch too: a `^0.10.x`
  dependent resolves the new surface without a range change, which is what the carriers need once they
  are published from another repository.

  **One condition ships open, and it is not in this surface.** A database that is migrated and then
  **booted** without `module:install` running marks every module installed and never fires an install
  hook, so the seeded rows do not appear — where the old seed migration wrote them regardless. A
  generated instance is unaffected (`migrate` then `module:install --all`); this repository's dev flow
  is. It is written up in `specs/deferred-defects.md` and sequenced for repair before the same seam is
  adopted for `payment_methods`.

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- 8f61a6b: Every published package now ships its own `LICENSE` and `README.md`.

  npm force-includes a file named `LICENSE` into the tarball exactly as it does `README.md`,
  whatever `files` says, so the text has to be in the package directory and not only at the
  repository root — `LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md` states that rule and, until this release, no package
  obeyed it. Measured on `master`: **0** of the 82 publishable packages carried a `LICENSE` and
  **14** carried a `README.md`, so every tarball shipped without licence text and 68 registry
  pages would have rendered empty.

  Both files are **generated**, by `pnpm --filter backend run manifests:generate`, and refused
  when stale by `manifests:check` in the `quality` job:
  - the `LICENSE` is the repository's root `LICENSE`, copied verbatim — the same single source
    the `license: MIT` field is already rendered from. A package that declares a licence of its
    own in the `SEE LICENSE IN <file>` form is skipped and keeps the file it names.
  - the `README.md` is rendered from what the package's own manifest declares: its description,
    its module id where it has one, every published subpath with what that layer holds, its peer
    dependencies with the optional ones marked, the locales its `i18n/` carries and what the
    tarball ships. A `README.md` **without** the generated marker on its first line is a human's
    and is never rewritten — the fourteen that existed are untouched.

  Five module packages also get their npm description back. `@endora-commerce/mod-blog`,
  `mod-credit-limits`, `mod-dhl-parcel`, `mod-google-analytics` and `mod-quote-requests` carried
  the note written when they were moved out of `backend/src/modules` — _"the first module to
  leave backend/src/modules … the manifest id stays identity of record"_ — as the sentence a
  registry shows under the package name. Each now carries the sentence its own module manifest
  declares, which is where `descriptionFor` seeds one from in the first place.

  No API changes, no new dependency, no behaviour change: what moves is what the tarball carries
  and what a package page says.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 0eeb9b5: Require Node >= 22.18.0.

  The previous floor was 22.17.0, which MikroORM 7 sets. 22.18.0 is the first release that
  strips TypeScript types without a flag, and that is what loads a deployment's overlay module:
  in a scaffolded instance `apps/` is outside every compiled member, so the unit the platform
  `import()`s is the client's own `.ts`. On 22.17.x that import throws
  `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` and the process dies before it listens. Emitting a `.js` beside
  the client's source was measured and refused — the overlay loader resolves `.js` before `.ts`
  while the divergence derivation admits both, so the sibling doubles every seam site in the
  report.

  Derived by probing 22.17.0, 22.17.1, 22.18.0 and 22.19.0 against a `.ts` module imported with
  no flag; 22.18.0 is the lowest that loads it.

  If you run 22.17.x, upgrade to 22.18 or later. Nothing else in these packages changed.

### Minor Changes

- bd596a9: The sales-channel bridge tables are declared by the modules that own them, not by the platform.

  **`@endora-commerce/platform`** — `SalesChannelMembershipService` no longer holds a map total over
  `ChannelMemberEntityTypeSchema`. It resolves `{ table, entityIdColumn }` through a new
  `ChannelBridgeRegistry`, which each owning module fills at compose time, and a composition root
  contributes as the container name `salesChannelBridgeRegistry`. `composeSalesChannelsKernel` takes
  an optional `bridgeRegistry` and returns the one it used on `SalesChannelsKernel.bridgeRegistry`.

  For a consumer the visible change is at the call site: a membership call for an entity type **no
  installed module registered** now refuses with `503 MODULE_DISABLED`, naming the entity type in
  `error.details`, **before** it reaches the database. It previously executed SQL against the table
  the map named, which on an instance that never installed the owning module is a relation that does
  not exist — inside whatever transaction the caller had already opened. `ChannelMemberEntityType`
  is unchanged and stays the published vocabulary; the registry decides which of its members are
  live.

  `SalesChannelMembershipService`'s constructor takes the registry as an optional fourth argument,
  defaulting to the process-level one, so an existing construction site compiles and runs unchanged.

  **The module packages** — each now exports `salesChannelBridges`, the bridge or bridges it owns,
  from its `./backend` subpath, and registers them from a boot hook. `catalog` owns two (`product`
  and `category`); the other seven own one each. The registration is a contribution and carries no
  presence probe: the rows outlive an operator switching the module off, so the bridge stays
  readable, exactly as the asset-reference and language-reference registries state for their own
  contributions.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels`** — `SalesChannelsService` held a second copy of the same
  nine triples, read by the channel-delete sweep, justified by a circular import that had not existed
  since the membership service moved into the kernel. It is gone; the service takes the registry as a
  new required constructor argument, in fifth position, and the delete sweep iterates the bridges
  that are actually registered — so a channel can be deleted on an instance that never installed
  `cms`.

- 2fe0b8d: Each sales-channel bridge table is now created by the module that owns its far side.

  Under D-226 a bridge between an always-present near side and a switchable far side belongs to the
  far side. All nine `sales_channel_*` tables move accordingly, so an instance that does not install
  `cms` no longer carries a migration corpus naming `cms_pages`.

  **Nothing is re-offered to a database you have already migrated, and no reset is required.**
  `mikro_orm_migrations` stores the migration class **name** and no checksum — measured on
  `@mikro-orm/migrations@6.6.13`: `MigrationStorage.ensureTable()` builds `id`, `name` and
  `executed_at`, `logMigration` inserts `{ name }`, and `getPendingMigrations()` is `umzug.pending()`
  over those names. No class is renamed and no stamp moves, so the two edited bodies are not pending
  anywhere.

  **`@endora-commerce/platform`** — two frozen migrations lose statements and keep their class names.
  `Migration20260430T170044CoreSalesChannelsPromote` loses eight `create table "sales_channel_*"`
  statements with their indexes from `up()` and the matching eight `drop table` from `down()`;
  `Migration20260424T165847CoreFoundationInit` loses `create table "sales_channel_products"`, its
  index and its `drop table`. Everything those migrations do to a kernel table is untouched — the
  channel identity columns, the backfills, the one-system-default partial unique index and the
  `quote_requests.sales_channel_id` column all stay exactly where they were. `BASELINE_MIGRATIONS` is
  byte-identical, so no position in the frozen prefix moves.

  **Each far-side module** gains one migration (`@endora-commerce/mod-catalog` gains two, for
  `sales_channel_products` and `sales_channel_categories`). Each is a `create table if not exists`
  carrying the frozen statement's own column list, primary key, both foreign keys and index, plus a
  `create index if not exists`, and each drops its own table in `down()`. On a database that has
  applied the frozen migrations every one of them is a no-op: measured on a throwaway database
  migrated at the previous release and then upgraded, all nine relations keep their `pg_class` OID,
  so no table is recreated and no row is touched. On a fresh database they are the creation, later in
  the computed order than before — which is where they have to be for an instance that omits one of
  these modules to migrate at all.

  **One behaviour changes on purpose.** A hard uninstall reverts by registry `moduleId`, so
  `module:uninstall --hard cms` now drops `sales_channel_cms_pages` along with the rest of that
  module's schema. That is the ownership rule doing what it says, and it is what an operator would
  expect of a table whose far side has just been removed.

  The published `ChannelMemberEntityTypeSchema` vocabulary is unchanged, and no wire shape moves.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 384f5e2: The module declares its demo data: `manifest.demo` creates the free `in_person_pickup` method
  the demo shop checks out with, and withdraws it again.

  `endora demo seed` now reports `delivery_methods` by name with the method it created, and
  `endora demo reset` removes it. Both bodies are reached by a relative `await import()` from the
  manifest, so nothing is loaded by the processes that merely compose the platform, and the
  module gained no `exports` subpath, no `files` entry and no manifest `dependencies` entry.

  **The withdrawal changed, and it is a repair.** The host's demo reset used to clear this table
  with a `truncate … cascade`, which took every operator-created method with it and, through the
  cascade, the sales-channel and organisation bindings that pointed at them. It now deletes only
  the code `seed` assigns.

  Seeding twice creates nothing the second time and reports the same count.

- e27bf6c: Every package that ships scannable UI now publishes its own Tailwind `@source`
  declarations at a new `./tailwind.css` subpath.

  A host compiling this package's utility classes no longer has to know where the
  package's sources are. Import the subpath from the stylesheet that builds your
  admin, and the package names its own layers:

  ```css
  @import 'tailwindcss';
  @import '@endora-commerce/mod-blog/tailwind.css';
  ```

  `@source` resolves relative to the stylesheet that declares it, so the paths hold
  wherever the package is installed. The file is generated from the package's layer
  inventory, ships in the tarball beside `package.json`, and its `dist` line is the one
  that matters to you — the `src` line beside it is inert in a published package and
  exists so that a checkout of this repository keeps scanning source in `dev`.

  **Nothing is removed or renamed**: every existing subpath resolves exactly as before.
  What is new is the obligation on the _host_ side, and it is a build error rather than a
  silent one. Before this, a host reached these packages with a glob over the monorepo
  (`@source "../../packages/**"`), which named a directory no installed tree has —
  and Tailwind reports nothing at all about a source that matches nothing, so such a host
  built green and rendered every screen unstyled. A host that now names a package that is
  not installed gets `Can't resolve`, and one whose tarball omits the file gets
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.

  `@endora-commerce/cms-components` deliberately does **not** publish this subpath. It
  ships a finished, prefixed stylesheet at `./styles.css` and must not also be scanned by
  its host.

## 0.7.0

### Major Changes

- df749d7: `delivery_methods` declares `delivery_methods:read` and `delivery_methods:write`, and its admin
  routes enforce them instead of `catalog:read` / `catalog:write`.

  **Breaking for anyone whose roles reach either module's admin API.** The three
  `delivery_methods` routes moved:

  ```
  GET    /api/v1/admin/delivery-methods         catalog:read   -> delivery_methods:read
  PUT    /api/v1/admin/delivery-methods/:code   catalog:write  -> delivery_methods:write
  DELETE /api/v1/admin/delivery-methods/:id     catalog:write  -> delivery_methods:write
  ```

  And the shared route `@endora-commerce/mod-payment-methods` registers moved with them:

  ```
  GET    /api/v1/admin/order-statuses
    payment_methods:read OR catalog:read  ->  payment_methods:read OR delivery_methods:read
  ```

  That route is read by two admin editors — the payment-method screen and the delivery-method one
  — which is why it is an any-of. The `catalog:read` member was a placeholder for the delivery
  editor's gate while `delivery_methods` still borrowed the catalogue's authority; it is now that
  module's own read code, so no catalogue holder reaches the shared list any more.

  There is no data migration and that is deliberate: granting the new codes to every holder of
  `catalog:read` would reproduce the distribution the change exists to remove, which would make it a
  change of spelling rather than of authority. A role that was configuring delivery methods through
  the catalogue codes is granted `delivery_methods:read` / `delivery_methods:write` on
  `/admin-roles`, where the manifest puts them automatically.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n` carries the two `adminRoles.permission.delivery_methods:*` labels and
  the screen's refusal notice, in `en` and `pl`.

### Minor Changes

- 196fbfa: Six modules ship their admin surfaces, and the delivery-methods list becomes a zone its
  carriers contribute to.

  **New `./admin` subpath on six packages.** `@endora-commerce/mod-seo`,
  `mod-taxes`, `mod-credit-limits`, `mod-delivery-methods`, `mod-megamenu` and `mod-returns`
  each export `contributions` — an `AdminContributions` object — from
  `@endora-commerce/mod-<id>/admin`. Every component is a dynamic-import factory, so a
  consumer's bundler emits one chunk per screen. The routes are unchanged: `/seo`, `/taxes`,
  `/credit-limits`, `/delivery-methods`, `/megamenu` plus `/megamenu/:id`, and `/returns`
  plus its four sub-screens.

  Three things a consumer has to know about that half:
  - **The subpath needs a build.** `./admin` resolves at `dist/admin/index.js`, emitted by
    each package's new `tsconfig.ui.json`; a checkout that has not run
    `pnpm run build:packages` cannot resolve it.
  - **`@endora-commerce/admin-kit` and `react` become peer dependencies of all six.** The kit
    is where every screen's design-system import resolves, and `react` is peered rather than
    depended on so the application resolves one copy.
  - **Each package now ships an `i18n/` bundle carrying its own `nav.*.label`.** The sidebar
    label is module-relative — `nav.seo.label`, `nav.taxes.label`, `nav.creditLimits.label`,
    `nav.deliveryMethods.label`, `nav.megamenu.label`, `nav.returns.label` — resolved in the
    module's own namespace instead of the shared `core` one.

  **New in `@endora-commerce/contracts`:**
  - `AdminZoneNameSchema` gains `'delivery_method.list.integrations'`, the first member whose
    host is not the product editor, with `DeliveryMethodIntegrationsZoneProps` (empty: the
    host renders one card per shipping integration and has no identifier to name one by) and
    its `AdminZonePropsMap` entry.
  - `KnownIconNameSchema` gains `'Newspaper'`, which `megamenu`'s sidebar entry names now
    that it declares its own row rather than importing the glyph.

  **New in `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`:** `DeliveryMethodIntegrationsZoneProps` is re-exported
  from `./contributions`, and `resolveIcon('Newspaper')` answers.

  **`mod-dhl-parcel` and `mod-inpost` each gain a zone contribution**, on the `./admin`
  subpath they already had:

  ```ts
  zoneComponent(
    'delivery_method.list.integrations',
    () => import('./zones/DeliveryMethodIntegrationCard.js'),
    {
      weight: 100,
      requiredPermission: 'dhl_parcel:read',
    },
  );
  ```

  `delivery_methods` used to render both cards itself, with each carrier's title, description,
  route and permission code written into its own file. A third carrier now needs no edit to a
  file its author does not own, and the presence gate, the permission gate and the ordering are
  the zone renderer's.

  Nothing is removed and no existing export changes shape, so a consumer of any package's
  `./backend`, `./migrations` or root subpath is unaffected.

- 661e80d: Fourteen new packages: the **second** batch of modules to leave `backend/src/modules/`
  (feature 080, T040b). Five moved one at a time, then ten together; these fourteen are the
  same shape as the ten, and the properties below hold fourteen times over.

  **One changeset, not fourteen**, for the reason batch one gives: a changeset is written for
  the consumer of a package, and a package that did not exist a moment ago has no upgrader to
  instruct. What genuinely differs per package is its layer inventory, and that is the table.

  Every subpath is compiled output (D-164); none has a root wildcard; each package's `.` is
  its `manifest.ts`, where the generated manifest index reads the module's identity, its
  `dependencies`, its permission codes, its command-palette actions, its settings and its
  activation control.

  **`./backend` publishes `registerModule(ctx)` and an `entities` array, and no entity class by
  name** (D-168) — type-only exports included, which this batch measured rather than assumed:
  two packages published their entities' row types so the dev seed could name them, and
  `module-package-entity-surface.test.ts` refused both, in as many words — _"that is the one
  thing that makes a foreign module's `import type { … }` compile"_. The exports are gone and
  the seed takes each class off the published array by name.

  **One of the fourteen owns no table and says so with an empty array rather than by
  omission.** `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels` exports `entities: readonly never[] = []`.
  The distinction is not cosmetic: the platform's package loader answers a _missing_ export
  with `[]`, so "this module has no table" and "somebody forgot the array" would otherwise
  arrive as one silence, whose only symptom is a query against a table nobody created.

  **One package publishes a type on `./backend` that is not an entity**, and it is there
  because a composition root has to name a contribution it supplies:
  `@endora-commerce/mod-shopping-lists` re-exports `ShoppingListService`. A root cannot reach
  a package's internal file — `rootDir` makes a relative specifier into `packages/` TS6059
  even for an `import type` — so a contribution shape has to be on a published subpath or it
  is unnameable.

  **Two packages declare a `@fastify/*` dependency nothing imports.**
  `@endora-commerce/mod-mfa` peers on `@fastify/cookie` and `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa` on
  `@fastify/multipart`, because `reply.setCookie`, `request.isMultipart()` and
  `request.file()` are declaration-merging augmentations rather than imports. Inside the
  application those arrived ambiently through the host's own dependency; a package compiles
  against its own manifest, where an unnamed dependency does not exist. Both write
  `import type {} from '@fastify/…'`, which is type-only: the plugin is still the host's to
  register.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter` and `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa` also carry a companion
  `@types/*` in `devDependencies`** — `@types/nodemailer` and `@types/web-push` — which the
  manifest generator now derives. Nothing imports a `@types` package; the compiler finds it
  through `node_modules/@types`, which inside a package is the package's own declaration, so
  a module importing a JS-only library did not build until this landed.

### Patch Changes

- 896d52c: Both modules' activation-control descriptions now say what switching them off does to a
  shop, not only which surfaces disappear.

  No code, schema, export or manifest field other than the `description` string changes. The
  descriptions were accurate and stopped one step short of the consequence: _"the public list
  a checkout picks from"_ is exactly right, and what it means is that order placement answers
  `Delivery method is not active` / `Payment method is not active` and the shop takes no
  orders at all. An operator deciding whether to flip a switch reads the switch, so that
  sentence has to be there.

  If you render either description in your own operator surface, it is longer by one
  sentence.

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.
