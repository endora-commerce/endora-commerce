## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 8f61a6b: Every published package now ships its own `LICENSE` and `README.md`.

  npm force-includes a file named `LICENSE` into the tarball exactly as it does `README.md`,
  whatever `files` says, so the text has to be in the package directory and not only at the
  repository root — `LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md` states that rule and, until this release, no package
  obeyed it. Measured on `master`: **0** of the 82 publishable packages carried a `LICENSE` and
  **14** carried a `README.md`, so every tarball shipped without licence text and 68 registry
  pages would have rendered empty.

  Both files are **generated**, by `pnpm --filter backend run manifests:generate`, and refused
  when stale by `manifests:check` in the `quality` job:
  - the `LICENSE` is the repository's root `LICENSE`, copied verbatim — the same single source
    the `license: MIT` field is already rendered from. A package that declares a licence of its
    own in the `SEE LICENSE IN <file>` form is skipped and keeps the file it names.
  - the `README.md` is rendered from what the package's own manifest declares: its description,
    its module id where it has one, every published subpath with what that layer holds, its peer
    dependencies with the optional ones marked, the locales its `i18n/` carries and what the
    tarball ships. A `README.md` **without** the generated marker on its first line is a human's
    and is never rewritten — the fourteen that existed are untouched.

  Five module packages also get their npm description back. `@endora-commerce/mod-blog`,
  `mod-credit-limits`, `mod-dhl-parcel`, `mod-google-analytics` and `mod-quote-requests` carried
  the note written when they were moved out of `backend/src/modules` — _"the first module to
  leave backend/src/modules … the manifest id stays identity of record"_ — as the sentence a
  registry shows under the package name. Each now carries the sentence its own module manifest
  declares, which is where `descriptionFor` seeds one from in the first place.

  No API changes, no new dependency, no behaviour change: what moves is what the tarball carries
  and what a package page says.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 0eeb9b5: Require Node >= 22.18.0.

  The previous floor was 22.17.0, which MikroORM 7 sets. 22.18.0 is the first release that
  strips TypeScript types without a flag, and that is what loads a deployment's overlay module:
  in a scaffolded instance `apps/` is outside every compiled member, so the unit the platform
  `import()`s is the client's own `.ts`. On 22.17.x that import throws
  `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` and the process dies before it listens. Emitting a `.js` beside
  the client's source was measured and refused — the overlay loader resolves `.js` before `.ts`
  while the divergence derivation admits both, so the sibling doubles every seam site in the
  report.

  Derived by probing 22.17.0, 22.17.1, 22.18.0 and 22.19.0 against a `.ts` module imported with
  no flag; 22.18.0 is the lowest that loads it.

  If you run 22.17.x, upgrade to 22.18 or later. Nothing else in these packages changed.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- e27bf6c: Every package that ships scannable UI now publishes its own Tailwind `@source`
  declarations at a new `./tailwind.css` subpath.

  A host compiling this package's utility classes no longer has to know where the
  package's sources are. Import the subpath from the stylesheet that builds your
  admin, and the package names its own layers:

  ```css
  @import 'tailwindcss';
  @import '@endora-commerce/mod-blog/tailwind.css';
  ```

  `@source` resolves relative to the stylesheet that declares it, so the paths hold
  wherever the package is installed. The file is generated from the package's layer
  inventory, ships in the tarball beside `package.json`, and its `dist` line is the one
  that matters to you — the `src` line beside it is inert in a published package and
  exists so that a checkout of this repository keeps scanning source in `dev`.

  **Nothing is removed or renamed**: every existing subpath resolves exactly as before.
  What is new is the obligation on the _host_ side, and it is a build error rather than a
  silent one. Before this, a host reached these packages with a glob over the monorepo
  (`@source "../../packages/**"`), which named a directory no installed tree has —
  and Tailwind reports nothing at all about a source that matches nothing, so such a host
  built green and rendered every screen unstyled. A host that now names a package that is
  not installed gets `Can't resolve`, and one whose tarball omits the file gets
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.

  `@endora-commerce/cms-components` deliberately does **not** publish this subpath. It
  ships a finished, prefixed stylesheet at `./styles.css` and must not also be scanned by
  its host.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 05e9a63: `comparisons` gains `organization_id`, stamps it on every owned write, and
  refuses a row that names a customer account without one.

  `Comparison` gains an `organizationId` property and the `comparisons` table
  gains a nullable `organization_id` column, a partial index on it, and
  `check ("customer_account_id" is null or "organization_id" is not null)`. The
  migration first derives the missing organisation from the account that owns each
  comparison, then refuses — with the count and up to twenty ids, deleting nothing
  — anything it could not derive.

  **What changes for a reader.** `Comparison` is `@CustomerScoped`, and the tenant
  filter's `allowed-set` arm consults the ORM's metadata for this column per
  query: an administrator whose authority is a set of organisations saw **no**
  comparison at all while the column was absent, and now sees the comparisons of
  the organisations they are assigned to. The
  `meta.scopeNotice: 'ORGANIZATION_ATTRIBUTION_PENDING'` disclosure that explained
  that emptiness is no longer emitted for this table — it was keyed on the
  column's absence and retires with it.

  **What changes for a writer.** `ComparisonService` takes a
  `CustomerAccountReadPort` as its last constructor argument and resolves the
  owning account's organisation on both paths that can produce an owned row: the
  authenticated create in `addProduct`, and `adoptAnonymousComparison`, where a
  comparison that was legitimately ownerless while anonymous becomes owned. A
  composition that does not supply the port gets a refusal at those two writes
  rather than a row the constraint rejects. Every other method is unchanged, and
  the `withSystemScope` share-token lookup is untouched — a share link is still a
  cross-customer grant.

  **What can break.** An insert or update that sets `customer_account_id` without
  setting `organization_id` now fails with a check violation. A fixture or an
  external writer that builds a comparison by hand is the case to look at.

  The constraint is an **implication**, not an equivalence: an anonymous
  comparison is a representable state and carries no organisation. No foreign key
  is added.

- c94c52d: `api_keys`, `webhooks` and `comparisons` ship their admin surfaces, on a new `./admin` subpath
  each; `KnownIconNameSchema` gains two members and the kit's icon map the glyphs behind them.

  Each of the three module packages now exports `contributions` from
  `@endora-commerce/mod-<id>/admin` as an `AdminContributions` object whose every component is a
  dynamic-import factory, so a consumer's bundler emits one chunk per screen and none of it is
  downloaded by an operator who cannot reach it. The routes are unchanged — `/api-keys`,
  `/webhooks`, `/comparisons` and `/comparisons/:id` — and each package contributes a sidebar
  entry as well.

  Five things a consumer has to know:
  - **The subpath is a new `exports` entry, so it needs a build.** `./admin` resolves at
    `dist/admin/index.js`, emitted by each package's new `tsconfig.ui.json`. A checkout that has
    not run `pnpm run build:packages` cannot resolve it.
  - **`@endora-commerce/admin-kit`, `react` and `lucide-react` become peer dependencies of all
    three, and `react-router-dom` of `comparisons`.** They were backend-only packages before
    this. The kit is where every screen's design-system import now resolves, and React is peered
    rather than depended on so the application resolves one copy.
  - **Every route carries a `requiredPermission`, and the admin enforces it.**
    `integrations:manage` for `/api-keys` and `/webhooks`, `comparisons:read` for both comparison
    routes — in each case the code the screen's own API enforces. A host `<Route>` was ungated,
    so a consumer who deep-links one of these paths for an operator without the code now gets the
    admin's not-found treatment where the screen used to render and its API answered 403.
  - **`KnownIconNameSchema` gains `Webhook` and `Scale`.** A nav entry and a palette action name
    their icon; both glyphs were `lucide-react` imports inside the admin's own `AppShell.tsx`
    until this change, so keeping the sidebar looking the same meant adding the names rather than
    substituting two already on the allowlist. `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`'s `resolveIcon` maps
    both. Widening a `z.enum` is additive for a producer and narrowing for a consumer that
    exhaustively switches on `KnownIconName`; nothing in this repository does.
  - **Each of the three declares its first command-palette action** — `open-api-keys`,
    `open-webhooks` and `open-comparisons` — with both labels in the package's own `i18n/` bundle.
    A consumer resolving palette entries from the manifests will see one more per module.

  Nothing is removed and no existing export changes shape, so a consumer of any of the three
  `./backend`, `./migrations` or root subpaths is unaffected.

- ad62954: Fourteen more modules become workspace packages (feature 080, T040b batch three):
  `autopay`, `comparisons`, `credentials`, `dictionaries`, `google_tag_manager`,
  `ksef`, `meta_ads`, `paypal`, `payu`, `quick_order`, `search`, `stripe`, `taxes`
  and `tpay`. Each ships `dist` and resolves through its own `exports` map — the
  root for its manifest, `./backend` for `registerModule` plus the `entities`
  array, `./migrations` for its migration classes — exactly as the twenty-nine
  packages before them.

  **For a consumer of `@endora-commerce/mod-ksef`, one export is new and
  load-bearing.** `KsefUnavailableError` is now published by name on `./backend`:

  ```ts
  import { KsefUnavailableError } from '@endora-commerce/mod-ksef/backend';
  ```

  Anything implementing `KsefApiClientPort` — an overlay's client, a test double,
  a second gateway — must throw **that** class for an outage.
  `classifySubmissionError` decides "retry" from `instanceof`, so a caller holding
  a constructor of its own, or the class from a relative import into this
  package's source, gets its outage classified as `UNEXPECTED`: the submission is
  parked for an operator instead of queued for the sweep, silently. There is no
  behaviour change for a caller that already throws the module's own class.

  Nothing else in any of the fourteen changed shape. The move is a relocation:
  same entities, same migrations, same class names, same tables. The committed
  migration registry's `(moduleId, className)` declaration sequence and its
  computed execution sequence are byte-identical to the merge base — 158 entries,
  `declaration=2db29d89…`, `execution=c794685f…` — because packaging changes no
  manifest `dependencies` and the order is a function of those.

- 7af67c0: Declared as `peerDependencies` the packages these seven already publish types from (D-181).

  Each of them emits a `.d.ts` that imports a specifier its manifest declared only as a
  `devDependency`, which a consumer's install does not resolve. The consequence is silent:
  the type becomes `any`, and under `skipLibCheck: true` — what `tsc --init` writes — there
  is **no diagnostic at all**. Measured on `@endora-commerce/mod-catalog` with
  `@endora-commerce/mod-custom-fields` not installed: the exported
  `CatalogCradle.customFieldDefinitionService` typed as `any`, clean compile; with it
  installed, the correct `CustomFieldDefinitionApplyApi` and a refused assignment.

  Eleven peers, in two shapes:
  - **A published port interface of another module package** — `mod-catalog` →
    `mod-custom-fields`, `mod-customer-accounts` → `mod-organizations`, `mod-orders` →
    `mod-carts` / `mod-credit-limits` / `mod-inventory` / `mod-invoices` / `mod-promotions`,
    `mod-payments` → `mod-orders`. All are `import type … from '<pkg>/ports'` and all appear
    in the emitted declarations, so a consumer type-checking the package resolves them.
  - **A `@types/*` companion whose library reaches the declarations** — `@types/pdfmake`
    for `mod-invoices` and `mod-comparisons` (`pdfmake/interfaces.js` has no types without
    it), `@types/ssh2-sftp-client` for `mod-product-feeds`.

  **If you install one of these packages**, its peers are now install-time requirements
  rather than something your own tree happened to provide. `@types/nodemailer` and
  `@types/web-push` are deliberately _not_ among them: their libraries are imported inside
  function bodies and reach no published signature. Neither is `@types/react` or any other
  types package that contributes global declarations — those exist once in a program by
  construction, and forcing our copy is a conflict you could not fix.

  `minor` rather than `major`: nothing here changes an exported symbol or a call, and the
  requirement is one a consumer that type-checks these packages already had to satisfy for
  the types to mean anything. It is more than a patch because a resolver that was silently
  succeeding will now report an unmet peer.

### Patch Changes

- d567aa0: `comparisons` declares the four error codes it owns.

  `manifest.ts` gains an `errorCodes` array — feature 090 Phase 3
  (`specs/090-module-owned-error-codes/`). Nothing the package exports changes
  shape. The observable difference for a consumer is that this module's error
  sentences are now routed by its own declaration rather than only by the prefix
  chain in `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`, which continues to answer identically for
  every one of them: the list is the chain's own answer, copied verbatim from the
  frozen capture, and is asserted equal to it in both directions.

  `COMPARISON_EMPTY`, `COMPARISON_FULL`, `COMPARISON_NOT_FOUND` and
  `PDF_GENERATION_FAILED` are the four. `PRODUCT_NOT_IN_COMPARISON` is **not**
  among them: it names this module's own noun and is raised only by this package,
  and it is `catalog`'s — the chain's `PRODUCT_` rule runs before the
  `COMPARISON_` one, and re-routing is out of scope for this change. Going the
  other way, this package raises `PRODUCT_NOT_IN_COMPARISON` and
  `PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND` (`catalog`'s) and `INTERNAL` and `VALIDATION_FAILED` (the
  platform's), none of which is declared here.

  All four already carry a written sentence in both `en` and `pl` in this
  package's own `i18n/` bundles, so no sentence moves and none is added. No
  `tokens`: not one of the six raises of these codes passes a fourth argument, so
  no `details.code` discriminator can exist.

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.
