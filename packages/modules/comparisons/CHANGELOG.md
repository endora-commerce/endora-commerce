# @endora-commerce/mod-comparisons

## 0.109.0

### Minor Changes

- bdd04a7: The acquisition seams ask `catalogProductAvailabilityPort` (product data scopes per sales channel and language) instead of testing membership, audience or status themselves.

  - **Behaviour change for API clients — basket:** adding a product to the basket (single add and the batch add behind quick order, shopping-list and quote conversions) is refused with `404 PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND` — the answer an absent product gets — when the product is not effectively available at the basket's channel and the request's language (switched off there, outside its publication window, or outside the channel's audience rule). The add path used to test no status at all, so a `draft` member product could be put in a basket. A line whose product goes off after it was added stays in the basket and reads `unavailable` (`unavailableReason: 'not_purchasable'`); submitting the basket for approval and placing the order refuse it with `404 PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND` and its `cartItemIds`, and the checkout preview lists it as `product_unavailable`. The cart's up-sell strip shows only available products.
  - **Orders:** the admin order preview reports a member product that is not available in the chosen channel (at its default language) as `PRODUCT_NOT_IN_SALES_CHANNEL`. Reorder and quote conversion are unchanged (their lines are refused at placement as above).
  - **Quote requests:** a buyer's request (create, draft edit, resubmit) naming a product not available at the request's channel and language is refused with `404 PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND`. `POST /api/v1/admin/quote-requests` still accepts such a line and answers `warnings: [{ productId, code: 'PRODUCT_UNAVAILABLE_IN_SCOPE' }]` beside `data` (only when there is one).
  - **Comparisons and shopping lists:** a product not available at the request's channel and language cannot be added or saved (`404 PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND`); a comparison column reads `available` from the same answer; a saved line whose product went off is skipped on conversion as `product_not_found`.
  - **Quick order:** a pasted SKU of a product not available in the request's channel is rejected as `product_not_found`; the operator's import arm is unchanged.
  - **Effective names (FR-017):** basket line names and batch below-minimum outcomes, quote-request line snapshots (buyer: request language; operator: channel default) and comparison names and compared values follow the channel's overrides at the request language.

- ad74bf7: A shared comparison no longer discloses a product its reader cannot acquire. For any reader who is not the comparison's owner, a column whose product is not available at the reader's (channel, language) — archived, outside its window, outside its audience, switched off there — is the `(removed product)` column: no name, SKU, slug, price, image or compared values, and `hiddenProductCount` does not count it, so it reads exactly like a removed product. The owner keeps the column with its details and `available: false` only when the product is unavailable for a lifecycle reason (switched off at the scope, archived, outside its window, not a member of the channel); a product the owner may no longer see because of its audience is the `(removed product)` column for the owner too. For a reader who is not the owner, the `(removed product)` column's `id` is a random value per view, not the product's id. `ComparisonService.buildOwnerView` takes a fourth argument, `reader: 'owner' | 'recipient'` (exported as `ComparisonReader`), defaulting to `'recipient'`; the `/me` routes, the owner's PDF and the admin audit view pass `'owner'`, and the share route passes `'owner'` only when the reader owns the comparison.
- 61fc321: The storefront language is part of the URL path (`/pl/p/wiertarka`, `/en/p/drill`, issue #396).

  **Upgrade note for operators: existing sales channels keep their addresses.** The migration
  `Migration20261029T152922CoreSalesChannelsPrefixDefaultLanguage` adds the per-channel setting
  _Prefix the default language in URLs_ and switches it **off** on every channel that exists when it
  runs, so default-language URLs stay unprefixed; channels created later start **on**. To adopt
  prefixes for the default language too, switch _Prefix the default language in URLs_ on in
  _Sales channels_ → the channel. Other languages are prefixed either way: a former
  `/p/<key>?lang=<L>` link answers a permanent redirect to `/<prefix>/p/<key>`. A CMS page whose slug
  starts with a channel language prefix can no longer be saved.

  `@endora-commerce/contracts`:

  - New: `channelUrlLanguages`, `channelUrlLanguageAliases`, `storefrontPagePath`,
    `storefrontPagePathFor`, `storefrontDefaultPath`, `channelUrlLanguageSchema`,
    `channelUrlLanguageAliasSchema`, `URL_LANGUAGE_PREFIX_PATTERN`, types `ChannelUrlFacts`,
    `ChannelUrlLanguage`, `ChannelUrlLanguageAlias`; `productDefaultPath(key)`.
  - **`productPath` takes the channel's URL facts and never appends `?lang=`:**
    `productPath({ key, languageCode, channelDefaultLanguage })` (`/p/drill?lang=en-US`) becomes
    `productPath({ key, languageCode, channel })` (`/en/p/drill`), where `channel` is any
    `{ languages, defaultLanguage, prefixDefaultLanguage }` — the cached channel satisfies it.
  - `productKeyResolutionSchema`'s `redirect` requires `permanent` (`false` for a key of another
    channel language, answered 307); `productPagePathsSchema` requires `xDefault`.
  - Sales channel shapes carry `prefixDefaultLanguage` (create defaults to `true`); the public
    channel read answers `prefixDefaultLanguage`, `urlLanguages` and `urlLanguageAliases`.
  - `cmsPageUrl` (163 R24) takes the channel's URL facts and composes the prefixed path:
    `cmsPageUrl({ path, languageCode, channelDefaultLanguage })` (`/about-us?lang=en-US`) becomes
    `cmsPageUrl({ path, languageCode, channel })` (`/en/about-us`). The resolved CMS page's `url` and
    `alternates`, and the storefront page index, therefore carry each language's own slug under its
    prefix.
  - `CmsPageRecord` gains optional `languages` and `translations` (the `seo` sitemap lists each
    language at its own slug); `cmsPageSummarySchema` gains an optional
    `shadowedByLanguagePrefix` (any of the page's slugs, per-language ones included).

  Emitters (catalog, seo sitemap, product feeds, organizations, customers, newsletter, comparisons,
  mfa, invoices) compose prefixed storefront URLs; the product feed `link` uses the product's key in
  the feed language; the invoice e-mail links the storefront order page; the admin password reset
  links `/password-reset/confirm`. `cms-components` localizes block links through the render
  context's `localizePath`.

### Patch Changes

- 473ef09: Storefront links on the basket, the search results, comparisons and the quick-order type-ahead use the product's effective URL key at the request's sales channel and language (product data scopes), as the product page and the catalogue listing already did.

  - **Behaviour change for API clients:** `productSlug` of a basket line and of an up-sell candidate, `slug` of a Meilisearch result card, of a comparison column and of a quick-order search hit is the channel × language key, else the language key, else the global key. A product with its own key in a language used to be linked by its global key, which answers 404 in that language when `seo` is off. A basket line whose product is unavailable still has `productSlug: null`.
  - **Also:** a Meilisearch result card and a comparison column report the request channel's `minOrderQuantity`.
  - `search` and `comparisons` resolve `catalogProductUrlKeyReadPort`; `catalog` is already a dependency of both.

- 22604fa: **BREAKING — `CatalogGalleryPort.listForProducts` and `CatalogGalleryPort.baseImageUrls` gain a required second parameter, `channelId: string | null`.** Recorded at `minor`, which in a `0.x` series already takes every caret dependent out of range. A caller passes the sales channel it serves, or `null` for the previous, global answer: `listForProducts(ids)` → `listForProducts(ids, channelId)`, `baseImageUrls(ids)` → `baseImageUrls(ids, channelId)`. An implementer of the port (an overlay replacing catalog's gallery) adds the parameter and leaves out the items hidden in that channel; with `null` it answers as before.

  A gallery image hidden in a sales channel no longer reaches that channel's product feeds or comparisons (product data scopes).

  - **Contracts:** `CatalogGalleryPort.listForProducts(productIds, channelId)` and `CatalogGalleryPort.baseImageUrls(productIds, channelId)` take the channel the caller serves; `null` keeps the global answer.
  - **catalog:** `listForProducts` leaves out the items hidden in the channel. `baseImageUrls` answers the channel's own `base_image` holder, else the global one, and `null` when that holder is hidden there. Each is still one statement per batch.
  - **product_feeds:** a feed's images are read in the feed's channel.
  - **comparisons:** the base-image column is read in the viewer's resolved channel.

- bec2e83: Polish error messages are Polish sentences. 137 `errors.*` entries in these modules' `i18n/pl.json`
  bundles were placeholders — the word "Błąd:" followed by the error code lowercased, for example
  "Błąd: product not found." — and a request with `Accept-Language: pl` received them verbatim as
  `error.message`. Each is now a sentence in Polish, for example "Nie znaleziono produktu."

  Error codes, HTTP statuses and the English sentences are unchanged; a client matching on the code
  sees no difference.

- 1a88646: English error messages are English sentences. 137 `errors.*` entries in these modules'
  `i18n/en.json` bundles were the error code in Title Case with a full stop, for example
  "Product Not Found." or "Asset Legacy Locator Cannot Harden.", and a request in English received
  them verbatim as `error.message`. Each is now a sentence in sentence case, for example
  "Product not found." or "This file cannot be made private because it is stored at an address the
  platform did not issue. Upload it again first."

  Two Polish sentences were corrected to match what the code refuses: `CANNOT_MODIFY_SYSTEM_DEFAULT`
  (`mod-sales-channels`) now says the default sales channel can be neither deactivated nor deleted,
  and `MEGAMENU_TARGET_OUT_OF_SCOPE` (`mod-megamenu`) now names a page as well as a category.

  Error codes and HTTP statuses are unchanged; a client matching on the code sees no difference. A
  client that matched on the English message text must match the new sentences.

- f261ed3: The sales channel's `isPublic` flag is retired in favour of the pricing display-mode chain
  (issue #492; closes #467). The flag was documented as anonymous-price visibility, but every read of
  it withheld prices from **everyone** on the channel, signed-in buyers included, beside a chain that
  already says "prices after sign-in" per channel: `pricing.unauthenticated_display_mode = none`.

  **Behaviour change.** Signed-in buyers on a channel that had `isPublic = false` now see prices
  according to the display-mode chain (their organization's override, else the channel's
  `pricing.default_display_mode`), where they used to see none — on the catalogue listing, the product
  page, product links, search, comparisons, and the price sort and range, which are no longer refused
  to them. Anonymous visitors on such a channel still see no prices: the migration below carries that
  half of the flag over. A channel that had `isPublic = false` **and** its own value for
  `pricing.unauthenticated_display_mode` keeps that value, so its anonymous visitors now see prices if
  that value is a priced mode. A new channel, the boot-time default channel included, no longer starts
  with prices hidden from everyone; it follows the chain like any other.

  The display-mode chain itself is unchanged (owner ruling of 2026-10-28): a product or category
  override takes precedence over the channel's `pricing.unauthenticated_display_mode`, also for
  anonymous visitors, so a product overridden to `gross_only` shows its price to guests on a channel
  whose guest mode is `none`. An organization override still applies to signed-in buyers only.

  - **`@endora-commerce/platform`.** New migration `Migration20261028T173317CoreSalesChannelsRetireIsPublic`
    (core): every channel with `is_public = false` and no value of its own for
    `pricing.unauthenticated_display_mode` gets `"none"` as its per-channel value, then
    `sales_channels.is_public` is dropped. It refuses — rather than migrating into showing prices — a
    database that has a non-public channel but no registered `pricing.unauthenticated_display_mode`
    setting; start the platform once on the previous release, so the settings reconciler registers
    it, and migrate again. Because the column is dropped, stop processes running the previous release
    before migrating. `SalesChannel.isPublic` and `CachedChannel.isPublic` are removed;
    `SALES_CHANNELS_CACHE_KEY_PREFIX` moves from `sales-channels:v3:` to `sales-channels:v4:`, so no
    process reads an entry cached in the other shape. The default-channel reconciler no longer sets
    the flag.
  - **`@endora-commerce/contracts`.** `ResolvedSearchChannel.isPublic` is removed — drop it from the
    context you hand `SearchQueryPort`. No public HTTP shape carried the flag, so no response changes
    shape. The `SALES_CHANNEL_AUDIT_ACTIONS` documentation now says who writes each row: the identity
    Commands (with `stateBefore` / `stateAfter` snapshots) since #484.
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-catalog`.** `CatalogResolvedChannel.isPublic` and the `isPublic` field of
    `ProductLinkService`'s storefront context are removed. The catalogue no longer skips pricing on
    a channel: prices follow the viewer's display mode (a viewer whose mode is `none` gets the
    withheld answer, `resolvedPrice.displayMode: 'none'`, where the channel used to answer
    `resolvedPrice: null`). The price controls are refused only where the page's display mode is
    `none`; the reason "This sales channel does not publish prices…" is gone.
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-search`.** The service's `ResolvedSearchChannel.isPublic` is removed, and
    hits are always resolved for the viewer.
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-comparisons`.** A comparison is priced for the viewer on every channel.
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels`.** The channel form's _Open to anonymous visitors_ hint
    gains a second line pointing to the guest display mode, with a link to _Pricing settings_
    (`identity.anonymousAccess.pricesHint`, `identity.anonymousAccess.pricesLink`, English and
    Polish). New channels are no longer written with the flag.
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-price-lists`, `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`.** _Pricing settings_ states,
    under the two default modes, that a channel's own value wins over them and that a product or
    category override takes precedence over both, for anonymous visitors too
    (`priceLists.displayModes.settings.precedenceHint`).
  - **`@endora-commerce/demo-composition`.** The `pl_b2b_vip` channel is created without the flag and
    a new step, _the VIP channel hides prices until sign-in_, sets its
    `pricing.unauthenticated_display_mode` to `none`; its signed-in buyers see prices. `pl_retail`
    publishes prices to everyone, as before.
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-settings`, `@endora-commerce/cli`.** Comments only: the cache-clear
    namespace names the new key prefix, and the channel-resolution rule no longer cites the flag.

- c99b4cd: The command-palette actions of the commerce modules (`carts`, `catalog`, `comparisons`, `credit_limits`, `customer_accounts`, `customers`, `custom_fields`, `delivery_methods`, `dictionaries`, `document_templates`, `import_export`, `inventory`, `invoice_ledger`, `invoices`, `payment_methods`, `price_lists`, `product_feeds`, `promotions`, `quote_requests`, `sales_channels`, `taxes`) keep only English `keywords` in their manifests. Their Polish search words moved to each module's `i18n/pl.json` under the action's new `keywordsKey`, with an English entry in `i18n/en.json` (issue #573, following #560), and the ones that had been written without diacritics now carry them (`utwórz cennik`, `wyjaśnienie ceny`, `kolejność cen`). A Polish operator finds the same screens by the same words; an English-language admin is no longer offered the Polish ones.

## 0.108.0

### Minor Changes

- 0bd5a2b: **Behaviour change for API clients — additive field.** Comparison items and search hit summaries carry `minOrderQuantity`, read from the catalogue record (never from the search index): the product's minimum order quantity for `simple` and `configurable` products, `null` otherwise or when none is set. Storefronts can start a quantity input at the minimum.

### Patch Changes

- f367838: A resolver amount stays the decimal string `price_lists` answers with until it is rounded, and it is rounded only by the decimal helpers (`roundAmountHalfUp`, `grossAmountHalfUp`).

  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-product-feeds`.** The feed's price ports carry decimal strings: `NamedListPriceResolver` and `SelectionPricePort` answer `Map<string, string>` (was `Map<string, number>`), `AnonymousPriceResolver` answers `{ amount: string; isSale }`, `NamedListPriceResolvers.one` answers `string | null`, and `FeedItemPrice.net` / `.gross` are strings (`gross` already rounded to two places). A custom item-field resolver or a decoration of these ports reads strings now; the file's figures do not change.
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-quote-requests`.** A quote line's reference price is rounded from the resolver's decimal string, not from a JS number; anything but a non-negative decimal stores no reference.
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-comparisons`.** The comparison PDF, its document table block and the admin comparison screen write a price at two places, half-up: a price of 9.0450 was shown as `9.045 PLN`, and 1900 as `1900 PLN`.

- d2d3d9a: Comparison columns are priced on the signed-in customer's own customer group when it overrides their organization's (D-287 P0): the buyer's `customerAccountId` is passed to `resolveListingPrices`.
- e6f3a78: Unit prices are shown by the one rule of the owner ruling of 2026-10-25: two places when the third and fourth are zero, otherwise the significant places, up to four (`0,0125 zł`, `1,50 zł`, `1,505 zł`); line values and totals keep two.

  - `@endora-commerce/mod-invoices`: the invoice PDF's unit net price column (new `unitMoney` beside `money` in the PDF sections), the admin invoice screen and the template preview.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-carts`, `@endora-commerce/mod-customers`: the admin cart and the customer's cart history.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-comparisons`: a compared product's price on the screen, the canvas and the PDF (`1.50 PLN`, `0.0125 PLN`), where it was rounded to two places.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-crm`: an Opportunity's value of a linked Quote Request adds the quote's line values, each rounded to the cent once, as the quote desk does; it rounded only the sum.
  - `@endora-commerce/cms-components`: the CMS product card's price; the package now depends on `@endora-commerce/contracts` for the rule.

## 0.107.0

### Minor Changes

- dd939be: The comparison PDF can be designed in _Document templates_ (`specs/152-compare-pdf-template/`).

  - The module registers the `comparisons.comparison` document type with three blocks
    (`comparisons.ComparisonHeader`, `ComparisonTable`, `ComparisonShareLink`), every
    general-purpose block, and a built-in layout in English and Polish.
  - `GET /api/v1/comparisons/me/pdf` produces the PDF through `documentRenderPort` while
    `document_templates` is present: the language is the first `Accept-Language` tag the channel
    offers, else the channel's default; the new optional query `hideEmptyRows=true|false` drops rows
    with no value, as the storefront switch does. The response adds `content-language`. With
    `document_templates` off the fixed layout is printed, unchanged. File name, owner-only access and
    `409 COMPARISON_EMPTY` are unchanged.
  - **PDF layouts can change**: a buyer browsing in Polish now gets a Polish PDF with Polish product
    names, dates and prices.
  - Admin: a _PDF template_ button on the comparisons list (with `document_templates:read`), and the
    canvas renderers of the three blocks as `document` block contributions.

  migrations by a retired numbering (`024_settings_init.ts`, "migration 102", `080_returns_init.ts`
  and others), which matches no file in any package. Each reference now gives the real
  timestamped filename, such as `20260611T140346_catalog_product_value_overrides_init.ts`, and
  says which module owns it where that is a different module. The organizations page also no
  longer claims that the `suspended` → `blocked` migration writes an audit-log entry: it writes
  an explanatory `blocked_reason` on each remapped row.

## 0.101.1

### Patch Changes

- 69a3717: The `fastify` peer is now `^5.11.0` instead of `^5`, so an install can no longer resolve Fastify 5.0–5.10. On those versions an async route handler that calls `reply.send()` without `return` throws `ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT` as an uncaught exception from Fastify's onSend hook runner, and the process crash-loops; Fastify 5.11.0 catches that error and the server keeps running. An instance scaffolded by `endora new instance` now declares `fastify@^5.11.0` as well. Nothing to do on upgrade unless your project pins Fastify below 5.11 — move it to `^5.11.0` (the repository itself runs 5.12.5).

  `CHANGELOG.md` entry, with no change to what that entry says about the code.

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 8f61a6b: Every published package now ships its own `LICENSE` and `README.md`.

  npm force-includes a file named `LICENSE` into the tarball exactly as it does `README.md`,
  whatever `files` says, so the text has to be in the package directory and not only at the
  repository root — `LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md` states that rule and, until this release, no package
  obeyed it. Measured on `master`: **0** of the 82 publishable packages carried a `LICENSE` and
  **14** carried a `README.md`, so every tarball shipped without licence text and 68 registry
  pages would have rendered empty.

  Both files are **generated**, by `pnpm --filter backend run manifests:generate`, and refused
  when stale by `manifests:check` in the `quality` job:
  - the `LICENSE` is the repository's root `LICENSE`, copied verbatim — the same single source
    the `license: MIT` field is already rendered from. A package that declares a licence of its
    own in the `SEE LICENSE IN <file>` form is skipped and keeps the file it names.
  - the `README.md` is rendered from what the package's own manifest declares: its description,
    its module id where it has one, every published subpath with what that layer holds, its peer
    dependencies with the optional ones marked, the locales its `i18n/` carries and what the
    tarball ships. A `README.md` **without** the generated marker on its first line is a human's
    and is never rewritten — the fourteen that existed are untouched.

  Five module packages also get their npm description back. `@endora-commerce/mod-blog`,
  `mod-credit-limits`, `mod-dhl-parcel`, `mod-google-analytics` and `mod-quote-requests` carried
  the note written when they were moved out of `backend/src/modules` — _"the first module to
  leave backend/src/modules … the manifest id stays identity of record"_ — as the sentence a
  registry shows under the package name. Each now carries the sentence its own module manifest
  declares, which is where `descriptionFor` seeds one from in the first place.

  No API changes, no new dependency, no behaviour change: what moves is what the tarball carries
  and what a package page says.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 0eeb9b5: Require Node >= 22.18.0.

  The previous floor was 22.17.0, which MikroORM 7 sets. 22.18.0 is the first release that
  strips TypeScript types without a flag, and that is what loads a deployment's overlay module:
  in a scaffolded instance `apps/` is outside every compiled member, so the unit the platform
  `import()`s is the client's own `.ts`. On 22.17.x that import throws
  `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` and the process dies before it listens. Emitting a `.js` beside
  the client's source was measured and refused — the overlay loader resolves `.js` before `.ts`
  while the divergence derivation admits both, so the sibling doubles every seam site in the
  report.

  Derived by probing 22.17.0, 22.17.1, 22.18.0 and 22.19.0 against a `.ts` module imported with
  no flag; 22.18.0 is the lowest that loads it.

  If you run 22.17.x, upgrade to 22.18 or later. Nothing else in these packages changed.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- e27bf6c: Every package that ships scannable UI now publishes its own Tailwind `@source`
  declarations at a new `./tailwind.css` subpath.

  A host compiling this package's utility classes no longer has to know where the
  package's sources are. Import the subpath from the stylesheet that builds your
  admin, and the package names its own layers:

  ```css
  @import 'tailwindcss';
  @import '@endora-commerce/mod-blog/tailwind.css';
  ```

  `@source` resolves relative to the stylesheet that declares it, so the paths hold
  wherever the package is installed. The file is generated from the package's layer
  inventory, ships in the tarball beside `package.json`, and its `dist` line is the one
  that matters to you — the `src` line beside it is inert in a published package and
  exists so that a checkout of this repository keeps scanning source in `dev`.

  **Nothing is removed or renamed**: every existing subpath resolves exactly as before.
  What is new is the obligation on the _host_ side, and it is a build error rather than a
  silent one. Before this, a host reached these packages with a glob over the monorepo
  (`@source "../../packages/**"`), which named a directory no installed tree has —
  and Tailwind reports nothing at all about a source that matches nothing, so such a host
  built green and rendered every screen unstyled. A host that now names a package that is
  not installed gets `Can't resolve`, and one whose tarball omits the file gets
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.

  `@endora-commerce/cms-components` deliberately does **not** publish this subpath. It
  ships a finished, prefixed stylesheet at `./styles.css` and must not also be scanned by
  its host.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 05e9a63: `comparisons` gains `organization_id`, stamps it on every owned write, and
  refuses a row that names a customer account without one.

  `Comparison` gains an `organizationId` property and the `comparisons` table
  gains a nullable `organization_id` column, a partial index on it, and
  `check ("customer_account_id" is null or "organization_id" is not null)`. The
  migration first derives the missing organisation from the account that owns each
  comparison, then refuses — with the count and up to twenty ids, deleting nothing
  — anything it could not derive.

  **What changes for a reader.** `Comparison` is `@CustomerScoped`, and the tenant
  filter's `allowed-set` arm consults the ORM's metadata for this column per
  query: an administrator whose authority is a set of organisations saw **no**
  comparison at all while the column was absent, and now sees the comparisons of
  the organisations they are assigned to. The
  `meta.scopeNotice: 'ORGANIZATION_ATTRIBUTION_PENDING'` disclosure that explained
  that emptiness is no longer emitted for this table — it was keyed on the
  column's absence and retires with it.

  **What changes for a writer.** `ComparisonService` takes a
  `CustomerAccountReadPort` as its last constructor argument and resolves the
  owning account's organisation on both paths that can produce an owned row: the
  authenticated create in `addProduct`, and `adoptAnonymousComparison`, where a
  comparison that was legitimately ownerless while anonymous becomes owned. A
  composition that does not supply the port gets a refusal at those two writes
  rather than a row the constraint rejects. Every other method is unchanged, and
  the `withSystemScope` share-token lookup is untouched — a share link is still a
  cross-customer grant.

  **What can break.** An insert or update that sets `customer_account_id` without
  setting `organization_id` now fails with a check violation. A fixture or an
  external writer that builds a comparison by hand is the case to look at.

  The constraint is an **implication**, not an equivalence: an anonymous
  comparison is a representable state and carries no organisation. No foreign key
  is added.

- c94c52d: `api_keys`, `webhooks` and `comparisons` ship their admin surfaces, on a new `./admin` subpath
  each; `KnownIconNameSchema` gains two members and the kit's icon map the glyphs behind them.

  Each of the three module packages now exports `contributions` from
  `@endora-commerce/mod-<id>/admin` as an `AdminContributions` object whose every component is a
  dynamic-import factory, so a consumer's bundler emits one chunk per screen and none of it is
  downloaded by an operator who cannot reach it. The routes are unchanged — `/api-keys`,
  `/webhooks`, `/comparisons` and `/comparisons/:id` — and each package contributes a sidebar
  entry as well.

  Five things a consumer has to know:
  - **The subpath is a new `exports` entry, so it needs a build.** `./admin` resolves at
    `dist/admin/index.js`, emitted by each package's new `tsconfig.ui.json`. A checkout that has
    not run `pnpm run build:packages` cannot resolve it.
  - **`@endora-commerce/admin-kit`, `react` and `lucide-react` become peer dependencies of all
    three, and `react-router-dom` of `comparisons`.** They were backend-only packages before
    this. The kit is where every screen's design-system import now resolves, and React is peered
    rather than depended on so the application resolves one copy.
  - **Every route carries a `requiredPermission`, and the admin enforces it.**
    `integrations:manage` for `/api-keys` and `/webhooks`, `comparisons:read` for both comparison
    routes — in each case the code the screen's own API enforces. A host `<Route>` was ungated,
    so a consumer who deep-links one of these paths for an operator without the code now gets the
    admin's not-found treatment where the screen used to render and its API answered 403.
  - **`KnownIconNameSchema` gains `Webhook` and `Scale`.** A nav entry and a palette action name
    their icon; both glyphs were `lucide-react` imports inside the admin's own `AppShell.tsx`
    until this change, so keeping the sidebar looking the same meant adding the names rather than
    substituting two already on the allowlist. `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`'s `resolveIcon` maps
    both. Widening a `z.enum` is additive for a producer and narrowing for a consumer that
    exhaustively switches on `KnownIconName`; nothing in this repository does.
  - **Each of the three declares its first command-palette action** — `open-api-keys`,
    `open-webhooks` and `open-comparisons` — with both labels in the package's own `i18n/` bundle.
    A consumer resolving palette entries from the manifests will see one more per module.

  Nothing is removed and no existing export changes shape, so a consumer of any of the three
  `./backend`, `./migrations` or root subpaths is unaffected.

- ad62954: Fourteen more modules become workspace packages (feature 080, T040b batch three):
  `autopay`, `comparisons`, `credentials`, `dictionaries`, `google_tag_manager`,
  `ksef`, `meta_ads`, `paypal`, `payu`, `quick_order`, `search`, `stripe`, `taxes`
  and `tpay`. Each ships `dist` and resolves through its own `exports` map — the
  root for its manifest, `./backend` for `registerModule` plus the `entities`
  array, `./migrations` for its migration classes — exactly as the twenty-nine
  packages before them.

  **For a consumer of `@endora-commerce/mod-ksef`, one export is new and
  load-bearing.** `KsefUnavailableError` is now published by name on `./backend`:

  ```ts
  import { KsefUnavailableError } from '@endora-commerce/mod-ksef/backend';
  ```

  Anything implementing `KsefApiClientPort` — an overlay's client, a test double,
  a second gateway — must throw **that** class for an outage.
  `classifySubmissionError` decides "retry" from `instanceof`, so a caller holding
  a constructor of its own, or the class from a relative import into this
  package's source, gets its outage classified as `UNEXPECTED`: the submission is
  parked for an operator instead of queued for the sweep, silently. There is no
  behaviour change for a caller that already throws the module's own class.

  Nothing else in any of the fourteen changed shape. The move is a relocation:
  same entities, same migrations, same class names, same tables. The committed
  migration registry's `(moduleId, className)` declaration sequence and its
  computed execution sequence are byte-identical to the merge base — 158 entries,
  `declaration=2db29d89…`, `execution=c794685f…` — because packaging changes no
  manifest `dependencies` and the order is a function of those.

- 7af67c0: Declared as `peerDependencies` the packages these seven already publish types from (D-181).

  Each of them emits a `.d.ts` that imports a specifier its manifest declared only as a
  `devDependency`, which a consumer's install does not resolve. The consequence is silent:
  the type becomes `any`, and under `skipLibCheck: true` — what `tsc --init` writes — there
  is **no diagnostic at all**. Measured on `@endora-commerce/mod-catalog` with
  `@endora-commerce/mod-custom-fields` not installed: the exported
  `CatalogCradle.customFieldDefinitionService` typed as `any`, clean compile; with it
  installed, the correct `CustomFieldDefinitionApplyApi` and a refused assignment.

  Eleven peers, in two shapes:
  - **A published port interface of another module package** — `mod-catalog` →
    `mod-custom-fields`, `mod-customer-accounts` → `mod-organizations`, `mod-orders` →
    `mod-carts` / `mod-credit-limits` / `mod-inventory` / `mod-invoices` / `mod-promotions`,
    `mod-payments` → `mod-orders`. All are `import type … from '<pkg>/ports'` and all appear
    in the emitted declarations, so a consumer type-checking the package resolves them.
  - **A `@types/*` companion whose library reaches the declarations** — `@types/pdfmake`
    for `mod-invoices` and `mod-comparisons` (`pdfmake/interfaces.js` has no types without
    it), `@types/ssh2-sftp-client` for `mod-product-feeds`.

  **If you install one of these packages**, its peers are now install-time requirements
  rather than something your own tree happened to provide. `@types/nodemailer` and
  `@types/web-push` are deliberately _not_ among them: their libraries are imported inside
  function bodies and reach no published signature. Neither is `@types/react` or any other
  types package that contributes global declarations — those exist once in a program by
  construction, and forcing our copy is a conflict you could not fix.

  `minor` rather than `major`: nothing here changes an exported symbol or a call, and the
  requirement is one a consumer that type-checks these packages already had to satisfy for
  the types to mean anything. It is more than a patch because a resolver that was silently
  succeeding will now report an unmet peer.

### Patch Changes

- d567aa0: `comparisons` declares the four error codes it owns.

  `manifest.ts` gains an `errorCodes` array — feature 090 Phase 3
  (`specs/090-module-owned-error-codes/`). Nothing the package exports changes
  shape. The observable difference for a consumer is that this module's error
  sentences are now routed by its own declaration rather than only by the prefix
  chain in `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`, which continues to answer identically for
  every one of them: the list is the chain's own answer, copied verbatim from the
  frozen capture, and is asserted equal to it in both directions.

  `COMPARISON_EMPTY`, `COMPARISON_FULL`, `COMPARISON_NOT_FOUND` and
  `PDF_GENERATION_FAILED` are the four. `PRODUCT_NOT_IN_COMPARISON` is **not**
  among them: it names this module's own noun and is raised only by this package,
  and it is `catalog`'s — the chain's `PRODUCT_` rule runs before the
  `COMPARISON_` one, and re-routing is out of scope for this change. Going the
  other way, this package raises `PRODUCT_NOT_IN_COMPARISON` and
  `PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND` (`catalog`'s) and `INTERNAL` and `VALIDATION_FAILED` (the
  platform's), none of which is declared here.

  All four already carry a written sentence in both `en` and `pl` in this
  package's own `i18n/` bundles, so no sentence moves and none is added. No
  `tokens`: not one of the six raises of these codes passes a fourth argument, so
  no `details.code` discriminator can exist.

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.
