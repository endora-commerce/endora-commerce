### Patch Changes

- 32fdf20: The `LICENSE` file in each package now names the copyright holder as Endora sp. z o.o.

  The MIT licence text is unchanged; only its copyright line moves from `Copyright (c) 2026 Endora`
  to `Copyright (c) 2026 Endora sp. z o.o.`, the registered legal entity. Nothing a package exports,
  declares or depends on changes. `@endora-commerce/contracts` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-invoice-ledger` also carry a one-sentence rewording in an already-published
  `CHANGELOG.md` entry, with no change to what that entry says about the code.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- b413e2d: Connector family membership is declared in each module's own manifest and derived by the
  platform, replacing three hand-maintained arrays and the three boolean flags that
  duplicated them.

  ## Breaking: three manifest fields are removed

  _(Declared `minor` rather than `major` per **D-225**: no package leaves `0.x` before the
  move to public npmjs. In a `0.x` series the two carry the identical consumer-facing
  contract — `^0.9.0` excludes `0.10.0` exactly as it excludes `1.0.0` — so `minor` already
  forces the explicit opt-in that is what "breaking" means to a caller. The break is
  described below, which is where it belongs.)_

  `pimConnector`, `invoiceLedger` and `erpConnector` are gone from `ModuleManifestSchema`,
  along with `PIM_CONNECTOR_MODULES`, `INVOICE_LEDGER_MODULES` and `ERP_CONNECTOR_MODULES`.
  A module that declared one replaces it with a single additive line:

  ```ts
  capabilities: [CAPABILITY_KEYS.PIM_CONNECTOR],   // 'pim-connector'
  ```

  A capability's **owner** declares it mutually exclusive and mints the refusal code:

  ```ts
  exclusiveCapabilities: [
    { key: CAPABILITY_KEYS.PIM_CONNECTOR, errorCode: 'PIM_CONNECTOR_ALREADY_ACTIVE' },
  ],
  ```

  The declaration carries membership only, creates no lifecycle edge, and requires no
  dependency on the owner's package — a key is a string literal, on the same terms as an
  error code. That is the point of the change: a connector installed from npm, and a
  per-deployment overlay module, can now join a family, which an array inside
  `@endora-commerce/contracts` could never let them do without editing a file they do not
  own.

  ## Breaking behaviour on upgrade: three PIM connectors become inactive

  **Read this before upgrading if you run Akeneo, Ergonode or Pimcore.**

  `pim_akeneo`, `pim_ergonode` and `pim_pimcore` shipped activated by default. They now ship
  **deactivated**, as every member of a mutually exclusive capability must
  (owner ruling, 2026-09-15).
  - **If you chose explicitly** — you switched the connector on or off on
    `/platform/modules` at any point — a settings row records that choice and **nothing
    changes for you**. The new default applies only where no override exists.
  - **If you never chose**, those three connectors were running on the shipped default and
    will be **off** after this upgrade. Switch the one you use back on at
    `/platform/modules`; the choice is recorded and survives every later upgrade.

  Nothing is deleted. Connections, identity maps, field protections and run history are
  preserved exactly as they were, and come back when the connector is switched on — the
  reversal is two clicks and no data is touched. **No migration writes an activation row**:
  changing a shipped default must not rewrite an operator's recorded choice, and the two
  migration-shaped alternatives were considered and rejected — materialising the effective
  value for everyone would persist three simultaneous exclusive claims attributed to an
  operator who made none, and materialising it only where a connection exists would put a
  read across four connectors' tables inside another module's migration and would pick one
  arbitrarily wherever several qualified.

  **Why the default had to move rather than being tolerated.** Exclusivity is enforced when a
  module is _activated_, so it guards the transition and not the state a deployment starts
  in. Three connectors shipping activated were therefore all active from the first boot, with
  no transition to refuse and nothing to report it — and the one connector that consulted the
  registry was refused activation out of the box, naming a connector the operator had never
  configured. A member of an exclusive capability declaring `default: true` is now refused
  when the platform derives the family, because the activation resolver returns booleans and
  carries no provenance: nothing downstream can tell a recorded choice from a shipped
  default, so a member that ships activated holds a claim nobody made.

  ## Also in this change
  - Exclusivity is **one** seam per family — a single `pre` interceptor on
    `POST /api/v1/admin/modules/:id/activation`, registered by the capability's owner over
    the derived family. It previously lived on one member with that member's id hard-coded,
    which is why only 1 of the 12 ordered pairs of the four PIM connectors was refused; all
    12 are now.
  - Exclusion resolves **effective** module presence — platform availability _and_ operator
    activation. A connector a deployment never installed no longer holds a claim.
  - `pim_akeneo` no longer refuses a connection save because another connector has a
    connection; that path validates its own module's activation and nothing else. The
    refusal an operator meets is the activation one, with the same code and the same
    `{ activeModuleId }` detail.
  - `PimErgonodeConnectorActivityPort` is removed from `@endora-commerce/contracts`: it
    existed so one connector could ask another about its connections, and has no caller.
  - Two keys never exclude each other. One ERP connector, one PIM connector and one
    invoice-ledger vendor may run together, which was always true and is now asserted.

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 8f61a6b: Every published package now ships its own `LICENSE` and `README.md`.

  npm force-includes a file named `LICENSE` into the tarball exactly as it does `README.md`,
  whatever `files` says, so the text has to be in the package directory and not only at the
  repository root — `LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md` states that rule and, until this release, no package
  obeyed it. Measured on `master`: **0** of the 82 publishable packages carried a `LICENSE` and
  **14** carried a `README.md`, so every tarball shipped without licence text and 68 registry
  pages would have rendered empty.

  Both files are **generated**, by `pnpm --filter backend run manifests:generate`, and refused
  when stale by `manifests:check` in the `quality` job:
  - the `LICENSE` is the repository's root `LICENSE`, copied verbatim — the same single source
    the `license: MIT` field is already rendered from. A package that declares a licence of its
    own in the `SEE LICENSE IN <file>` form is skipped and keeps the file it names.
  - the `README.md` is rendered from what the package's own manifest declares: its description,
    its module id where it has one, every published subpath with what that layer holds, its peer
    dependencies with the optional ones marked, the locales its `i18n/` carries and what the
    tarball ships. A `README.md` **without** the generated marker on its first line is a human's
    and is never rewritten — the fourteen that existed are untouched.

  Five module packages also get their npm description back. `@endora-commerce/mod-blog`,
  `mod-credit-limits`, `mod-dhl-parcel`, `mod-google-analytics` and `mod-quote-requests` carried
  the note written when they were moved out of `backend/src/modules` — _"the first module to
  leave backend/src/modules … the manifest id stays identity of record"_ — as the sentence a
  registry shows under the package name. Each now carries the sentence its own module manifest
  declares, which is where `descriptionFor` seeds one from in the first place.

  No API changes, no new dependency, no behaviour change: what moves is what the tarball carries
  and what a package page says.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 0eeb9b5: Require Node >= 22.18.0.

  The previous floor was 22.17.0, which MikroORM 7 sets. 22.18.0 is the first release that
  strips TypeScript types without a flag, and that is what loads a deployment's overlay module:
  in a scaffolded instance `apps/` is outside every compiled member, so the unit the platform
  `import()`s is the client's own `.ts`. On 22.17.x that import throws
  `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` and the process dies before it listens. Emitting a `.js` beside
  the client's source was measured and refused — the overlay loader resolves `.js` before `.ts`
  while the divergence derivation admits both, so the sibling doubles every seam site in the
  report.

  Derived by probing 22.17.0, 22.17.1, 22.18.0 and 22.19.0 against a `.ts` module imported with
  no flag; 22.18.0 is the lowest that loads it.

  If you run 22.17.x, upgrade to 22.18 or later. Nothing else in these packages changed.

## 0.7.0

### Major Changes

- effb4e5: Stop republishing `@endora-commerce/contracts` symbols out of the two PIM packages.

  **Removed from `@endora-commerce/mod-pim-connector/backend`:**
  `canonicalisePimFieldPath` and `isValidPimFieldPath`, together with the
  `src/backend/services/field-path.ts` file that re-exported them. Both are, and
  have always been, `@endora-commerce/contracts`' own exports — the canonical
  implementation is `packages/contracts/src/pim-field-path.ts`, beside
  `pimFieldPathSchema` — and the module package added nothing but a second
  spelling of them.

  ```diff
  -import { canonicalisePimFieldPath } from '@endora-commerce/mod-pim-connector/backend';
  +import { canonicalisePimFieldPath } from '@endora-commerce/contracts';
  ```

  Nothing in this repository took either name from the module package:
  `pim_unopim`'s field-protection service and the unit test both already import
  them from `@endora-commerce/contracts` directly.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-pim-unopim`** drops `export type
{ UnopimPassportStatus };` from `src/backend/services/unopim-client.port.ts`.
  That file is internal — the `./backend` barrel republishes only
  `UnoPimClientPort` from it — so no published surface changes; the type was
  imported for the sole purpose of being re-exported and no consumer named it
  there. `UnopimPassportStatus` is unchanged in `@endora-commerce/contracts`.

  Both removals exist because a bare re-export is what the D-168 entity-surface
  analysis cannot follow: it reported `unresolvable-reexport` for each package,
  which is _"whether this barrel publishes an entity class by name is unknown"_
  rather than _"it does not"_. Neither re-export was load-bearing, so the answer
  is now known.

### Patch Changes

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.

- 2c8635b: Fix UnoPim media downloads: a stored media path now resolves to `<baseUrl>/storage/<path>`, the address Laravel's public disk actually serves, instead of `<baseUrl>/media/<path>`, which answered 404 for every file. An absolute `http://` media address is also left as-is rather than being appended to the base URL.

  Allow local development instances to fetch UnoPim media over HTTP when the development-only environment override is enabled.

  Import UnoPim attribute and option labels per locale, split comma-separated multiselect values, and map boolean source values onto the auto-created yes/no options. `CatalogProductWritePort` now exposes `patchAttributeOption` so a later import can refresh option labels.

  The UnoPim import-run detail now includes the recorded per-record issues so the operator can see why a run finished with issues.

  Import now reads UnoPim 3 `GET /configurable-products` in addition to `GET /products`, and maps `super_attributes` / `variants` onto Endora configurable products. Previously only the simple-product list was walked, so configurable parents were created as simple products.
