# @endora-commerce/mod-transactional-emails

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- e27bf6c: Every package that ships scannable UI now publishes its own Tailwind `@source`
  declarations at a new `./tailwind.css` subpath.

  A host compiling this package's utility classes no longer has to know where the
  package's sources are. Import the subpath from the stylesheet that builds your
  admin, and the package names its own layers:

  ```css
  @import 'tailwindcss';
  @import '@endora-commerce/mod-blog/tailwind.css';
  ```

  `@source` resolves relative to the stylesheet that declares it, so the paths hold
  wherever the package is installed. The file is generated from the package's layer
  inventory, ships in the tarball beside `package.json`, and its `dist` line is the one
  that matters to you — the `src` line beside it is inert in a published package and
  exists so that a checkout of this repository keeps scanning source in `dev`.

  **Nothing is removed or renamed**: every existing subpath resolves exactly as before.
  What is new is the obligation on the _host_ side, and it is a build error rather than a
  silent one. Before this, a host reached these packages with a glob over the monorepo
  (`@source "../../packages/**"`), which named a directory no installed tree has —
  and Tailwind reports nothing at all about a source that matches nothing, so such a host
  built green and rendered every screen unstyled. A host that now names a package that is
  not installed gets `Can't resolve`, and one whose tarball omits the file gets
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.

  `@endora-commerce/cms-components` deliberately does **not** publish this subpath. It
  ships a finished, prefixed stylesheet at `./styles.css` and must not also be scanned by
  its host.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 3eef7a2: `newsletter` and `transactional_emails` ship their admin surfaces.

  **New `./admin` subpath on two packages.** `@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-transactional-emails` each export `contributions` — an
  `AdminContributions` object — from `@endora-commerce/mod-<id>/admin`, and nothing else.
  Seventeen routes and nine sidebar entries between them, all at the paths and codes the
  hand-written host registrations carried:
  - `mod-newsletter` — `/newsletter/subscribers` (the landing route), `/newsletter/campaigns`,
    `/newsletter/campaigns/:id`, `/newsletter/campaigns/:id/stats`, `/newsletter/automations`,
    `/newsletter/automations/:id`, `/newsletter/tags` and `/newsletter/blocks` on
    `newsletter:read`; `/newsletter/campaigns/new`, `/newsletter/automations/new` and
    `/newsletter/provider` on `newsletter:write`, which is the code the API enforces on the
    `POST`s those three screens exist to make and the code the provider row already carried.
    Six sidebar rows, in the `newsletter` section at weights 100 through 600.
  - `mod-transactional-emails` — `/transactional-emails` (the landing route),
    `/transactional-emails/blocks`, `/transactional-emails/blocks/:id`,
    `/transactional-emails/templates`, `/transactional-emails/templates/:id` and
    `/transactional-emails/:code`, all on `transactional_emails:read`. Three sidebar rows, in
    the `messaging` section at weights 100, 200 and 300.

  Route components are dynamic-import factories, so a consumer's bundler emits one chunk per
  screen, and every screen resolves its design system through `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`.

  **Both packages declare `@endora-commerce/page-builder-admin` as a peer dependency**, and
  that is what makes the two a batch rather than two rows. Their whole recorded admin debt was
  six reaches into `admin/src/modules/_shared/email-builder/`; P5b published that directory as
  `@endora-commerce/page-builder-admin/email`, so the six became bare specifiers into an
  `exports` map and there was nothing left to repair. Three `newsletter` screens (the campaign
  editor, the automation builder and the block editor) and three `transactional_emails` ones
  (both fragment editors and the e-mail editor, through this module's own `EmailEditorPane`
  adapter) mount `EmailEditorPane` and `EmailVariablesProvider` from it. `manifests:generate`
  derives the peer from those specifiers; a consumer installing either package from a registry
  must be able to resolve it.

  **Two new components on `mod-transactional-emails`, both internal to its `./admin` layer.**
  `EmailBlockEditorPage` and `EmailTemplateEditorPage` each render `EmailFragmentEditor` with
  one `kind`. The admin host used to pass that as a prop from its route table
  (`element={<EmailFragmentEditor kind="block" />}`), and an `AdminRouteDeclaration.component`
  is a factory returning a module whose `default` is read — there is nowhere in a declaration
  to put an argument.

  **Three new palette actions**, replacing hand-written rows in the admin shell, with the same
  destinations, codes and keywords:
  - `mod-newsletter` — `open-newsletter-campaigns` → `/newsletter/campaigns` and
    `open-newsletter-automations` → `/newsletter/automations`, both `newsletter:read`.
  - `mod-transactional-emails` — `open-email-blocks` → `/transactional-emails/blocks`,
    `transactional_emails:read`.

  Both packages' `i18n/{en,pl}.json` gain the nav labels (`nav.subscribers.label` and its five
  siblings; `nav.transactionalEmails.label`, `nav.emailBlocks.label`,
  `nav.emailTemplates.label`) and the new actions' label and description keys, module-relative
  and in both shipped languages.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-i18n` loses fifteen keys**: `appShell.nav.newsletter*` (six),
  `appShell.nav.transactionalEmails`, `appShell.nav.emailBlocks`, `appShell.nav.emailTemplates`
  and the six `appShell.palette.sub.*` keys the deleted palette rows named. Nothing renders
  them after this change — the labels are the two modules' own now. `appShell.section.messaging`
  and `appShell.section.newsletter` stay: the shell still owns the section taxonomy.

- f66359f: The stored Page Builder block names are namespaced, once, by five migrations.

  Each of the five table-owning modules rewrites **its own** columns — `cms` three, `blog`
  two, `transactional_emails` three, `newsletter` two, `invoices` one — with a recursive
  `pg_temp` function generated from `FROZEN_BLOCK_RENAMES`. A migration belongs to the module
  that owns the **table**, never to the module that owns the new name, so no new manifest
  `dependencies` edge arises: a block name is a string value inside a JSONB document, not a
  foreign key.

  The rewrite is **structural**: it replaces the value of a `type` property in a node position
  and nothing else. Twelve of the 74 names are ordinary English words (`Row`, `Text`, `Image`,
  `Map`, `Button`, …) that occur throughout shop content, so a textual substitution would
  corrupt a `RawHtml` block's markup and every `alt` attribute in the shop.

  It is **idempotent by construction** — every key of the map is bare and every value is
  dotted, so a second run finds nothing — and it **cannot fail on its input**: a name the map
  does not hold is left byte-identical and reported, never quarantined. `down()` applies the
  inverse over the identical walk.

  `cms` gains an operator command for the pre-flight:

  ```
  pnpm --filter backend run cli -- cms block-names
  ```

  Read-only, across all eleven columns, classifying every stored name as _will be renamed →
  new name_, _already namespaced_ or _unrecognised_. Run it before upgrading, resolve or accept
  the unrecognised set, take a backup, upgrade, and run it again: every _will be renamed_
  becomes _already namespaced_ and the unrecognised set is unchanged.

  `catalog`, `orders` and `ksef` are patch-bumped because their block declarations are now what
  the registry serves — the eight `catalog` blocks, the eight `orders` ones and
  `ksef.InvoiceSection` were previously registered as `cms`' and `invoices`'.

- 661e80d: Fourteen new packages: the **second** batch of modules to leave `backend/src/modules/`
  (feature 080, T040b). Five moved one at a time, then ten together; these fourteen are the
  same shape as the ten, and the properties below hold fourteen times over.

  **One changeset, not fourteen**, for the reason batch one gives: a changeset is written for
  the consumer of a package, and a package that did not exist a moment ago has no upgrader to
  instruct. What genuinely differs per package is its layer inventory, and that is the table.

  Every subpath is compiled output (D-164); none has a root wildcard; each package's `.` is
  its `manifest.ts`, where the generated manifest index reads the module's identity, its
  `dependencies`, its permission codes, its command-palette actions, its settings and its
  activation control.

  **`./backend` publishes `registerModule(ctx)` and an `entities` array, and no entity class by
  name** (D-168) — type-only exports included, which this batch measured rather than assumed:
  two packages published their entities' row types so the dev seed could name them, and
  `module-package-entity-surface.test.ts` refused both, in as many words — _"that is the one
  thing that makes a foreign module's `import type { … }` compile"_. The exports are gone and
  the seed takes each class off the published array by name.

  **One of the fourteen owns no table and says so with an empty array rather than by
  omission.** `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels` exports `entities: readonly never[] = []`.
  The distinction is not cosmetic: the platform's package loader answers a _missing_ export
  with `[]`, so "this module has no table" and "somebody forgot the array" would otherwise
  arrive as one silence, whose only symptom is a query against a table nobody created.

  **One package publishes a type on `./backend` that is not an entity**, and it is there
  because a composition root has to name a contribution it supplies:
  `@endora-commerce/mod-shopping-lists` re-exports `ShoppingListService`. A root cannot reach
  a package's internal file — `rootDir` makes a relative specifier into `packages/` TS6059
  even for an `import type` — so a contribution shape has to be on a published subpath or it
  is unnameable.

  **Two packages declare a `@fastify/*` dependency nothing imports.**
  `@endora-commerce/mod-mfa` peers on `@fastify/cookie` and `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa` on
  `@fastify/multipart`, because `reply.setCookie`, `request.isMultipart()` and
  `request.file()` are declaration-merging augmentations rather than imports. Inside the
  application those arrived ambiently through the host's own dependency; a package compiles
  against its own manifest, where an unnamed dependency does not exist. Both write
  `import type {} from '@fastify/…'`, which is type-only: the plugin is still the host's to
  register.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter` and `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa` also carry a companion
  `@types/*` in `devDependencies`** — `@types/nodemailer` and `@types/web-push` — which the
  manifest generator now derives. Nothing imports a `@types` package; the compiler finds it
  through `node_modules/@types`, which inside a package is the package's own declaration, so
  a module importing a JS-only library did not build until this landed.

- afedd32: Six modules declare the Page Builder blocks they own — all 74 of them.

  Each package's exported `manifest` gains `blocks` and `blockCategories`, and each
  ships the `blocks.<local>.label`, `blocks.<local>.description` and
  `blocks.category.<key>` entries for them in `i18n/en.json` and `i18n/pl.json`:

  | Package                    | Blocks              | Category declarations  |
  | -------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
  | `mod-cms`                  | 30                  | 8 CMS sections         |
  | `mod-catalog`              | 8 (5 CMS, 3 e-mail) | 2                      |
  | `mod-orders`               | 8 e-mail            | 1 (`order`)            |
  | `mod-transactional-emails` | 17 e-mail           | 4                      |
  | `mod-invoices`             | 10 invoice          | 1 (`invoice`)          |
  | `mod-ksef`                 | 1 invoice           | 1 (`invoice`, joining) |

  **Nothing reads these declarations yet.** The Page Builder registry is still
  populated from the single hand-written `register('cms', …)` call, the three Puck
  configs are still keyed by the bare names, and no stored document changes. Read
  the block `name`s as the names those blocks will have, not as names anything
  resolves today.

  Two `(key, context)` sections are declared by two modules each and **merge**:
  the e-mail `content` section (`mod-transactional-emails` names it,
  `mod-catalog` joins) and the `invoice` section (`mod-invoices` names it,
  `mod-ksef` joins). A joining declaration carries its own `titleKey` and omits
  `weight` and `visible`, so it cannot take a presentation its author did not
  intend to take while still being able to title the section on its own when the
  namer is switched off.

  Three sections change owner or gain a member, which is the point of the exercise
  rather than a side effect: the CMS `catalog` section is `mod-catalog`'s (`cms`
  hand-writes it and owns no block in it); the e-mail `order` section is
  `mod-orders`'; `cms.InsertTemplate` and `transactional_emails.EmailInsertTemplate`
  gain a section, having had none; and `transactional_emails.EmailColumn` moves into
  a new hidden `internal` section.

  `mod-cms`' bundles rename one key: `pageBuilder.categories._internal` becomes
  `pageBuilder.categories.internal`, following the category key in
  `@endora-commerce/cms-components`. The rendered title is unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 3786732: Error-code ownership: the rest of Tier A is declared by the modules that own its nouns.

  `manifest.errorCodes` gains six codes on `@endora-commerce/mod-prompt-actions`
  (`ASSISTANT_*`, `PROMPT_*`), five on `@endora-commerce/mod-custom-fields` (`CUSTOM_FIELD_*`),
  two on `@endora-commerce/mod-customers` (`CUSTOMER_ADDRESS_NOT_FOUND`,
  `REGISTRATION_REQUIRES_ORGANIZATION`), two on `@endora-commerce/mod-shopping-lists`
  (`SHOPPING_LIST_*`), one on `@endora-commerce/mod-price-lists` (`PRICE_LIST_NOT_FOUND`) and one
  on `@endora-commerce/mod-transactional-emails` (`TRANSACTIONAL_EMAIL_NOT_DEACTIVATABLE`);
  `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n` drops the same seventeen from its own declaration, which is what
  decides where the error envelope looks for a sentence (D-129's remaining sweep, MR 3 of eight;
  D-121 tiers T1 and T2; `specs/090-module-owned-error-codes/d129-sweep.md`).

  For a consumer this changes which bundle answers for those codes. No wire shape moves —
  `error.code` is unchanged — and no sentence is relocated: none of the seventeen had a
  translation in `en` or `pl` in any bundle. Writing one of those sentences is now a change to the
  owning module's own `i18n/{en,pl}.json` rather than to the platform's.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-shopping-lists` gains an `i18n` bundle it never had, declared as
  `i18n: { bundlesDir: 'i18n' }` and shipped in `files`. It holds the two `SHOPPING_LIST_*`
  sentences in both languages, which is an operator- and buyer-visible improvement: a Polish
  reader refused a delete of the default or the last shopping list now reads Polish prose instead
  of the English the raise site carries.

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.
