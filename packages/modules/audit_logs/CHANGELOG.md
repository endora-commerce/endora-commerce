## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 8f61a6b: Every published package now ships its own `LICENSE` and `README.md`.

  npm force-includes a file named `LICENSE` into the tarball exactly as it does `README.md`,
  whatever `files` says, so the text has to be in the package directory and not only at the
  repository root — `LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md` states that rule and, until this release, no package
  obeyed it. Measured on `master`: **0** of the 82 publishable packages carried a `LICENSE` and
  **14** carried a `README.md`, so every tarball shipped without licence text and 68 registry
  pages would have rendered empty.

  Both files are **generated**, by `pnpm --filter backend run manifests:generate`, and refused
  when stale by `manifests:check` in the `quality` job:
  - the `LICENSE` is the repository's root `LICENSE`, copied verbatim — the same single source
    the `license: MIT` field is already rendered from. A package that declares a licence of its
    own in the `SEE LICENSE IN <file>` form is skipped and keeps the file it names.
  - the `README.md` is rendered from what the package's own manifest declares: its description,
    its module id where it has one, every published subpath with what that layer holds, its peer
    dependencies with the optional ones marked, the locales its `i18n/` carries and what the
    tarball ships. A `README.md` **without** the generated marker on its first line is a human's
    and is never rewritten — the fourteen that existed are untouched.

  Five module packages also get their npm description back. `@endora-commerce/mod-blog`,
  `mod-credit-limits`, `mod-dhl-parcel`, `mod-google-analytics` and `mod-quote-requests` carried
  the note written when they were moved out of `backend/src/modules` — _"the first module to
  leave backend/src/modules … the manifest id stays identity of record"_ — as the sentence a
  registry shows under the package name. Each now carries the sentence its own module manifest
  declares, which is where `descriptionFor` seeds one from in the first place.

  No API changes, no new dependency, no behaviour change: what moves is what the tarball carries
  and what a package page says.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 0eeb9b5: Require Node >= 22.18.0.

  The previous floor was 22.17.0, which MikroORM 7 sets. 22.18.0 is the first release that
  strips TypeScript types without a flag, and that is what loads a deployment's overlay module:
  in a scaffolded instance `apps/` is outside every compiled member, so the unit the platform
  `import()`s is the client's own `.ts`. On 22.17.x that import throws
  `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` and the process dies before it listens. Emitting a `.js` beside
  the client's source was measured and refused — the overlay loader resolves `.js` before `.ts`
  while the divergence derivation admits both, so the sibling doubles every seam site in the
  report.

  Derived by probing 22.17.0, 22.17.1, 22.18.0 and 22.19.0 against a `.ts` module imported with
  no flag; 22.18.0 is the lowest that loads it.

  If you run 22.17.x, upgrade to 22.18 or later. Nothing else in these packages changed.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- e27bf6c: Every package that ships scannable UI now publishes its own Tailwind `@source`
  declarations at a new `./tailwind.css` subpath.

  A host compiling this package's utility classes no longer has to know where the
  package's sources are. Import the subpath from the stylesheet that builds your
  admin, and the package names its own layers:

  ```css
  @import 'tailwindcss';
  @import '@endora-commerce/mod-blog/tailwind.css';
  ```

  `@source` resolves relative to the stylesheet that declares it, so the paths hold
  wherever the package is installed. The file is generated from the package's layer
  inventory, ships in the tarball beside `package.json`, and its `dist` line is the one
  that matters to you — the `src` line beside it is inert in a published package and
  exists so that a checkout of this repository keeps scanning source in `dev`.

  **Nothing is removed or renamed**: every existing subpath resolves exactly as before.
  What is new is the obligation on the _host_ side, and it is a build error rather than a
  silent one. Before this, a host reached these packages with a glob over the monorepo
  (`@source "../../packages/**"`), which named a directory no installed tree has —
  and Tailwind reports nothing at all about a source that matches nothing, so such a host
  built green and rendered every screen unstyled. A host that now names a package that is
  not installed gets `Can't resolve`, and one whose tarball omits the file gets
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.

  `@endora-commerce/cms-components` deliberately does **not** publish this subpath. It
  ships a finished, prefixed stylesheet at `./styles.css` and must not also be scanned by
  its host.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- e5ae42c: `mfa`, `carts`, `audit_logs`, `admin_users` and `admin_roles` ship their admin surfaces, on a
  new `./admin` subpath each.

  Each of the five now exports `contributions` from `@endora-commerce/mod-<id>/admin` as an
  `AdminContributions` object — six routes and three sidebar entries between them. Every
  component is a dynamic-import factory, so a consumer's bundler emits one chunk per screen.

  Six things a consumer has to know:
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-admin-roles/admin` declares a sidebar entry and no route.** The
    `/admin-roles` screen is served by `GET /api/v1/admin/admin-roles` in `admin_users`, so
    `@endora-commerce/mod-admin-users/admin` declares that route alongside its own
    `/admin-users`, while `admin_roles` declares the sidebar entry and the palette action that
    advertise it. All three arrays of `AdminContributions` are optional and a nav-only
    contribution is supported; a consumer rendering the registry needs both packages for the
    roles screen to be both reachable and advertised.
  - **Three sidebar labels moved namespace.** `appShell.nav.users`, `appShell.nav.roles` and
    `appShell.nav.auditLog` were in `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`'s shared `core` bundle; they
    are now `nav.adminUsers.label`, `nav.adminRoles.label` and `nav.auditLog.label` in each
    package's own `i18n/`, resolved in the module's own scope. Anything reading an old key gets
    a raw key back. The text is unchanged in both languages, and the screens' own keys did not
    move.
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-admin-users` and `@endora-commerce/mod-audit-logs` ship an `i18n/`
    directory for the first time**, and their manifests declare `i18n.bundlesDir` accordingly.
    A consumer that mirrored `files` by hand needs the new directory.
  - **Three packages declare `actions` for the first time**: `open-admin-users`,
    `open-admin-roles` and `open-audit-log`. They are ⌘K palette entries, resolved by the
    server against the effective enabled-set, and they pay three of the fifteen remaining
    entries in this repository's Principle XVI debt. `mfa` and `carts` still declare none —
    neither contributes a sidebar entry, which is that debt's population.
  - **`@endora-commerce/contracts` adds `ShieldCheck` to `KnownIconNameSchema`**, and
    `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`'s `resolveIcon` maps it. Additive: no existing name changes,
    and a consumer validating an icon name against the old enum keeps working. It is needed
    because a nav entry declares its glyph **by name**, so keeping the one the sidebar already
    drew meant adding the name rather than substituting one already on the list.
  - **All five packages now peer on `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`, `react` and, where a screen
    routes, `react-router-dom` and `lucide-react`.** They are peers rather than dependencies
    for the reason `page-builder-core` is: the application must resolve exactly one copy, and a
    provider in one copy against a consumer in the other is a `null` context at runtime rather
    than a type error.

- 3ad96d8: Ten new packages: the first **batch** of modules to leave `backend/src/modules/`
  (feature 080, T040b). Five moved one at a time before them; these ten move together, and
  the properties below are the same ten times over.

  **One changeset, not ten, and that is a judgement rather than a shortcut.** A changeset is
  written for the consumer of a package, and for a package that did not exist a moment ago
  there is no upgrader to instruct — every one of the ten says the same thing, _"this package
  now exists, here are its subpaths, and here is what it deliberately does not export"_. Ten
  files carrying one rationale would be nine copies of a derived fact. What genuinely differs
  per package is its layer inventory, and that is the table below.

  Every subpath is compiled output (D-164); none has a root wildcard; each package's `.` is
  its `manifest.ts`, where the generated manifest index reads the module's identity, its
  `dependencies`, its permission codes, its command-palette actions, its settings and its
  activation control.

  | Package                                | Subpaths                         | Entities                          | Migrations | Ships          |
  | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
  | `@endora-commerce/mod-health-checks`   | `.`, `./backend`                 | —                                 | —          | `dist`         |
  | `@endora-commerce/mod-audit-logs`      | `.`, `./backend`                 | —                                 | —          | `dist`         |
  | `@endora-commerce/mod-addresses`       | `.`, `./backend`                 | `Address`                         | —          | `dist`         |
  | `@endora-commerce/mod-currencies`      | `.`, `./backend`                 | `Currency`                        | —          | `dist`         |
  | `@endora-commerce/mod-languages`       | `.`, `./backend`, `./migrations` | `Language`                        | 1          | `dist`         |
  | `@endora-commerce/mod-seo`             | `.`, `./backend`, `./migrations` | `SeoMetaOverride`, `SitemapCache` | 1          | `dist`         |
  | `@endora-commerce/mod-analytics`       | `.`, `./backend`, `./migrations` | `AnalyticsEvent`                  | 1          | `dist`         |
  | `@endora-commerce/mod-import-export`   | `.`, `./backend`                 | —                                 | —          | `dist`, `i18n` |
  | `@endora-commerce/mod-shipments`       | `.`, `./backend`, `./migrations` | `Shipment`                        | 2          | `dist`         |
  | `@endora-commerce/mod-payment-methods` | `.`, `./backend`, `./migrations` | `PaymentMethod`                   | 2          | `dist`, `i18n` |

  **`./backend` publishes `registerModule(ctx)` and an `entities` array, and no entity class by
  name** (D-168). The classes in that column are imported to build the array and are exported
  under no name, so `import type { PaymentMethod } from '@endora-commerce/mod-payment-methods/backend'`
  does not compile in a consumer's tree, whoever the consumer is. A foreign key still works —
  `shipments.order_id -> orders.id` is between two column names and needs the table, never the
  owner's class.

  **Three of the ten own no table, and say so with an empty array rather than by omission.**
  `health-checks`, `audit-logs` and `import-export` export `entities: readonly never[] = []`.
  The distinction is not cosmetic: the platform's package loader answers a _missing_ export with
  `[]`, so "this module has no table" and "somebody forgot the array" would otherwise arrive as
  one silence, whose only symptom is a query against a table nobody created.

  **`./migrations` publishes a `migrations` array plus each class by name.** The asymmetry with
  `./backend` is deliberate — `mikro_orm_migrations` persists the class name, so it is a string
  every already-migrated database holds, while an entity class name is contract to nobody.

  **Two behavioural removals, both in `./backend`, both affecting no caller in this repository.**
  `@endora-commerce/mod-currencies/backend` no longer re-exports `CURRENCY_CHANGED_EVENT` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-languages/backend` no longer re-exports `LANGUAGE_CHANGED_EVENT`. Both
  constants live in `@endora-commerce/contracts` and have since feature 075's Phase P; the
  re-exports were that phase's compatibility shim, kept for consumers that turned out not to
  exist. Import them from `@endora-commerce/contracts`, which is where the one and only
  `dictionaries` consumer already reads them.

  ```ts
  // before — from the module barrel
  import { CURRENCY_CHANGED_EVENT } from '@endora-commerce/mod-currencies/backend';
  // after — from the contracts package, where the constant is declared
  import { CURRENCY_CHANGED_EVENT } from '@endora-commerce/contracts';
  ```

### Patch Changes

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.
