# @endora-commerce/mod-settings

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 21dac4f: `dictionaries`, `settings` and `credentials` ship their admin surfaces, and a module can
  publish a React component to another module for the first time.

  **New `./admin` subpath on four packages.** `@endora-commerce/mod-dictionaries`,
  `@endora-commerce/mod-settings` and `@endora-commerce/mod-credentials` each export
  `contributions` — an `AdminContributions` object — from `@endora-commerce/mod-<id>/admin`,
  and nothing else. `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa` already exported one and it grows a `routes`
  entry. Nine routes and ten nav entries in total, all at the paths and codes the
  hand-written host registrations carried:
  - `mod-dictionaries` — `/dictionary`, `/dictionaries/audit` and `/admin/dictionaries/audit`,
    all `dictionary.write`; sidebar rows for `/dictionary` and `/admin/dictionaries/audit`.
  - `mod-settings` — `/settings` and `/settings/groups` on `settings:read`, `/settings/cache`
    on `settings:write`; a sidebar row for each.
  - `mod-credentials` — `/credentials` on `credentials:read` and `/credentials/new` on
    `credentials:write`; one sidebar row.
  - `mod-pwa` — `/settings/pwa` on `pwa:read`, beside the sidebar row it has declared since
    the previous wave. `PwaPage`, `PushAudienceRuleBuilder` and the `pwa` admin API client
    moved into this package from `mod-settings`' directory, where they had been since before
    either was a package.

  Route components are dynamic-import factories, so a consumer's bundler emits one chunk per
  screen, and every screen resolves its design system through `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`.

  **New `./admin-ui` subpath on `@endora-commerce/mod-credentials`, and it is a new kind of
  subpath.** It exports `ConfigurationPreviewModal` and its `ConfigurationPreviewModalProps` —
  a read-only view of one credential configuration with every secret masked, taking
  `{ open, configuration, onClose }`. This is the first package in the repository to publish a
  React component to another package rather than to the admin application, and three things
  about it are contract rather than convenience:
  - **It is not the kit.** A component whose rendering is generic over its data belongs in
    `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`; this one calls `useTranslation('credentials')`, so every
    string it shows is the owner's vocabulary and the kit refuses it.
  - **A consumer gates presence itself.** `credentials` carries an operator activation
    control, and a statically imported component is filtered by nothing — so the consumer
    wraps the render in `useSurfaceVisibility()({ module: 'credentials' })`. With the module
    switched off the caller must render nothing rather than a modal over an API that answers 503.
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-credentials` becomes a peer dependency of
    `@endora-commerce/mod-settings`.** The reach survives into emitted JavaScript, so a
    consumer that bundles `mod-settings`' admin layer has to resolve the owner.

  **`@endora-commerce/admin-kit`:** `toAbsoluteAssetUrl` now trims its argument and returns a
  protocol-relative URL (`//cdn.example.com/x.png`) unchanged. It previously prefixed such a
  URL with the API origin, producing `https://api.example.com//cdn.example.com/x.png`, which
  loads nothing. Existing callers passing an absolute, `data:`, `blob:` or host-relative URL
  are unaffected. `resolveIcon` answers for two more names, `Languages` and `Eraser`.

  **`@endora-commerce/contracts`:** `KnownIconNameSchema` gains `'Languages'` and `'Eraser'`.
  Additive — no previously valid icon name is rejected.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`:** ten `appShell.*` keys are **removed** from the shared
  bundle — `appShell.nav.{cache,credentials,dictionary,dictionaryAudit,settingGroups,settings}`
  and `appShell.palette.sub.{credentials,dictionary,dictionaryAudit,platformConfiguration}`.
  Their replacements are `nav.*.label` keys in the three modules' own bundles, resolved in each
  module's own namespace. **A consumer rendering one of those ten keys by hand will render the
  raw key**; there is no compatibility alias, because a key with one consumer in two bundles is
  the duplication this feature removes.

  **Both shipped languages, everywhere.** Every new key — the six `nav.*.label`s,
  `mod-settings`' `editor.credentialRef.preview` and `mod-dictionaries`' four
  `actions.openDictionary*` strings — ships in `en` and `pl`.

  **`mod-dictionaries` declares two command-palette actions**, `open-dictionary` and
  `open-dictionary-audit`, both on `dictionary.write`. They replace hand-written rows in the
  admin's own palette table, so what an operator sees is unchanged; what changes is that the
  server now filters them against the effective enabled-set, which the hand-written rows were
  never asked about.

  **Build.** `./admin` resolves at `dist/admin/index.js` and `./admin-ui` at
  `dist/admin-ui/index.js`, both emitted by each package's `tsconfig.ui.json`. A checkout that
  has not run `pnpm run build:packages` cannot resolve either. All four packages' `build` and
  `typecheck` scripts now run two `tsc` invocations, and `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`, `react`,
  `react-router-dom` and `lucide-react` become peer dependencies where a screen names them.

- e637f56: Seven more modules become workspace packages (feature 080, T040b batch four):
  `assets_library`, `carts`, `custom_fields`, `customers`, `email`, `invoices` and
  `settings`. Each ships `dist` and resolves through its own `exports` map — the
  root for its manifest, `./backend` for `registerModule` plus the `entities`
  array, `./migrations` for its migration classes where it owns any — exactly as
  the forty-three packages before them.

  Three things a consumer of one of these packages should know.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-carts`, `@endora-commerce/mod-custom-fields` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-invoices` publish a `./ports` subpath.** It is type-only:
  `tsc` emits `export {};`, and it is where a consumer names
  `CartPlacementApplyPort`, `CustomFieldDefinitionApplyApi` and
  `InvoicePlacementApplyPort` instead of reaching into the owner's directory.

  ```ts
  import type { CartPlacementApplyPort } from '@endora-commerce/mod-carts/ports';
  ```

  The implementations stay behind their container names
  (`cartPlacementApplyPort`, `customFieldDefinitionApplyApi`,
  `invoicePlacementApplyPort`) and are resolved with `lazyPort`, never through
  this subpath.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-settings` declares `entities` as an empty array.** The
  module owns no table — the settings store is the platform's — and the empty
  array is the statement, because the host reads a _missing_ export as `[]` and a
  forgotten one would be indistinguishable from an honest none.

  **No entity class is exported by name from any of the seven**, `import type`
  included (D-168). A consumer that must construct one takes it off the published
  `entities` array by name; `Cart`, `Invoice` and the rest are deliberately not
  importable.

### Patch Changes

- f563590: `settings` declares the ten error codes it owns.

  `manifest.ts` gains an `errorCodes` array — feature 090 Phase 3
  (`specs/090-module-owned-error-codes/`). Nothing the package exports changes
  shape. The observable difference for a consumer is that this module's error
  sentences are now routed by its own declaration rather than only by the prefix
  chain in `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`, which continues to answer identically for
  every one of them: the list is the chain's own answer, copied verbatim from the
  frozen capture, and is asserted equal to it in both directions.

  Nine of the ten already carry a written sentence in both `en` and `pl` in this
  package's own `i18n/` bundles, and those nine are exactly the `errors.*` keys
  those bundles hold, so no sentence moves and none is added.
  `SETTING_SECRET_KEY_MISSING` is an `UNTRANSLATED_ERROR_CODES` entry today and
  stays one.

  No `tokens`: all seventeen raise sites of these ten codes were read across
  `packages` and `backend/src`, and none passes a `details.code` discriminator —
  the two that pass a fourth argument at all pass the Zod-style
  `Array<{path, issue}>`, which the envelope ignores by construction.
