# @endora-commerce/mod-pwa

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 21dac4f: `dictionaries`, `settings` and `credentials` ship their admin surfaces, and a module can
  publish a React component to another module for the first time.

  **New `./admin` subpath on four packages.** `@endora-commerce/mod-dictionaries`,
  `@endora-commerce/mod-settings` and `@endora-commerce/mod-credentials` each export
  `contributions` — an `AdminContributions` object — from `@endora-commerce/mod-<id>/admin`,
  and nothing else. `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa` already exported one and it grows a `routes`
  entry. Nine routes and ten nav entries in total, all at the paths and codes the
  hand-written host registrations carried:
  - `mod-dictionaries` — `/dictionary`, `/dictionaries/audit` and `/admin/dictionaries/audit`,
    all `dictionary.write`; sidebar rows for `/dictionary` and `/admin/dictionaries/audit`.
  - `mod-settings` — `/settings` and `/settings/groups` on `settings:read`, `/settings/cache`
    on `settings:write`; a sidebar row for each.
  - `mod-credentials` — `/credentials` on `credentials:read` and `/credentials/new` on
    `credentials:write`; one sidebar row.
  - `mod-pwa` — `/settings/pwa` on `pwa:read`, beside the sidebar row it has declared since
    the previous wave. `PwaPage`, `PushAudienceRuleBuilder` and the `pwa` admin API client
    moved into this package from `mod-settings`' directory, where they had been since before
    either was a package.

  Route components are dynamic-import factories, so a consumer's bundler emits one chunk per
  screen, and every screen resolves its design system through `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`.

  **New `./admin-ui` subpath on `@endora-commerce/mod-credentials`, and it is a new kind of
  subpath.** It exports `ConfigurationPreviewModal` and its `ConfigurationPreviewModalProps` —
  a read-only view of one credential configuration with every secret masked, taking
  `{ open, configuration, onClose }`. This is the first package in the repository to publish a
  React component to another package rather than to the admin application, and three things
  about it are contract rather than convenience:
  - **It is not the kit.** A component whose rendering is generic over its data belongs in
    `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`; this one calls `useTranslation('credentials')`, so every
    string it shows is the owner's vocabulary and the kit refuses it.
  - **A consumer gates presence itself.** `credentials` carries an operator activation
    control, and a statically imported component is filtered by nothing — so the consumer
    wraps the render in `useSurfaceVisibility()({ module: 'credentials' })`. With the module
    switched off the caller must render nothing rather than a modal over an API that answers 503.
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-credentials` becomes a peer dependency of
    `@endora-commerce/mod-settings`.** The reach survives into emitted JavaScript, so a
    consumer that bundles `mod-settings`' admin layer has to resolve the owner.

  **`@endora-commerce/admin-kit`:** `toAbsoluteAssetUrl` now trims its argument and returns a
  protocol-relative URL (`//cdn.example.com/x.png`) unchanged. It previously prefixed such a
  URL with the API origin, producing `https://api.example.com//cdn.example.com/x.png`, which
  loads nothing. Existing callers passing an absolute, `data:`, `blob:` or host-relative URL
  are unaffected. `resolveIcon` answers for two more names, `Languages` and `Eraser`.

  **`@endora-commerce/contracts`:** `KnownIconNameSchema` gains `'Languages'` and `'Eraser'`.
  Additive — no previously valid icon name is rejected.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`:** ten `appShell.*` keys are **removed** from the shared
  bundle — `appShell.nav.{cache,credentials,dictionary,dictionaryAudit,settingGroups,settings}`
  and `appShell.palette.sub.{credentials,dictionary,dictionaryAudit,platformConfiguration}`.
  Their replacements are `nav.*.label` keys in the three modules' own bundles, resolved in each
  module's own namespace. **A consumer rendering one of those ten keys by hand will render the
  raw key**; there is no compatibility alias, because a key with one consumer in two bundles is
  the duplication this feature removes.

  **Both shipped languages, everywhere.** Every new key — the six `nav.*.label`s,
  `mod-settings`' `editor.credentialRef.preview` and `mod-dictionaries`' four
  `actions.openDictionary*` strings — ships in `en` and `pl`.

  **`mod-dictionaries` declares two command-palette actions**, `open-dictionary` and
  `open-dictionary-audit`, both on `dictionary.write`. They replace hand-written rows in the
  admin's own palette table, so what an operator sees is unchanged; what changes is that the
  server now filters them against the effective enabled-set, which the hand-written rows were
  never asked about.

  **Build.** `./admin` resolves at `dist/admin/index.js` and `./admin-ui` at
  `dist/admin-ui/index.js`, both emitted by each package's `tsconfig.ui.json`. A checkout that
  has not run `pnpm run build:packages` cannot resolve either. All four packages' `build` and
  `typecheck` scripts now run two `tsc` invocations, and `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`, `react`,
  `react-router-dom` and `lucide-react` become peer dependencies where a screen names them.

- fc34995: `pwa` ships an admin surface that is a sidebar entry and nothing else.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa/admin` is a new subpath exporting `contributions` — an
  `AdminContributions` object with **one `nav` entry and no `routes`**. That combination is
  legal and was, until now, unexercised: the type's own documentation says _"a module shipping
  only a nav entry pointing at a host route is legal"_, and every conversion before this one
  moved a route. The entry advertises `/settings/pwa`, labelled `nav.pwa.label` in this
  package's own `i18n/{en,pl}.json` rather than in the shared bundle, in section `system` at
  weight 1400, gated on `pwa:read`.

  Two things a consumer has to know:
  - **The screen at that path is not in this package.** `PwaPage` lives in the admin
    application, under a directory `settings` owns, so the route is still declared by the host.
    A consumer that renders the registry's nav without the admin's own route table will show an
    entry pointing at a path it does not serve. That resolves when `settings` ships its own
    admin layer.
  - **`Smartphone` joins the icon allowlist.** `KnownIconNameSchema` gains the name and the
    kit's `resolveIcon` maps it to the lucide component of that name — the pair AGENTS.md's
    command-palette checklist requires in one merge request, because a name on the allowlist
    with no entry in the map renders the generic `Sparkles` fallback. It is added rather than
    substituted so the sidebar keeps the glyph it already drew.

- 661e80d: Fourteen new packages: the **second** batch of modules to leave `backend/src/modules/`
  (feature 080, T040b). Five moved one at a time, then ten together; these fourteen are the
  same shape as the ten, and the properties below hold fourteen times over.

  **One changeset, not fourteen**, for the reason batch one gives: a changeset is written for
  the consumer of a package, and a package that did not exist a moment ago has no upgrader to
  instruct. What genuinely differs per package is its layer inventory, and that is the table.

  Every subpath is compiled output (D-164); none has a root wildcard; each package's `.` is
  its `manifest.ts`, where the generated manifest index reads the module's identity, its
  `dependencies`, its permission codes, its command-palette actions, its settings and its
  activation control.

  **`./backend` publishes `registerModule(ctx)` and an `entities` array, and no entity class by
  name** (D-168) — type-only exports included, which this batch measured rather than assumed:
  two packages published their entities' row types so the dev seed could name them, and
  `module-package-entity-surface.test.ts` refused both, in as many words — _"that is the one
  thing that makes a foreign module's `import type { … }` compile"_. The exports are gone and
  the seed takes each class off the published array by name.

  **One of the fourteen owns no table and says so with an empty array rather than by
  omission.** `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels` exports `entities: readonly never[] = []`.
  The distinction is not cosmetic: the platform's package loader answers a _missing_ export
  with `[]`, so "this module has no table" and "somebody forgot the array" would otherwise
  arrive as one silence, whose only symptom is a query against a table nobody created.

  **One package publishes a type on `./backend` that is not an entity**, and it is there
  because a composition root has to name a contribution it supplies:
  `@endora-commerce/mod-shopping-lists` re-exports `ShoppingListService`. A root cannot reach
  a package's internal file — `rootDir` makes a relative specifier into `packages/` TS6059
  even for an `import type` — so a contribution shape has to be on a published subpath or it
  is unnameable.

  **Two packages declare a `@fastify/*` dependency nothing imports.**
  `@endora-commerce/mod-mfa` peers on `@fastify/cookie` and `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa` on
  `@fastify/multipart`, because `reply.setCookie`, `request.isMultipart()` and
  `request.file()` are declaration-merging augmentations rather than imports. Inside the
  application those arrived ambiently through the host's own dependency; a package compiles
  against its own manifest, where an unnamed dependency does not exist. Both write
  `import type {} from '@fastify/…'`, which is type-only: the plugin is still the host's to
  register.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter` and `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa` also carry a companion
  `@types/*` in `devDependencies`** — `@types/nodemailer` and `@types/web-push` — which the
  manifest generator now derives. Nothing imports a `@types` package; the compiler finds it
  through `node_modules/@types`, which inside a package is the package's own declaration, so
  a module importing a JS-only library did not build until this landed.

- e12188d: `pwa` gains `organization_id` on `push_subscriptions`, stamps it on every owned
  write, clears it with the account, and refuses a row that names a customer
  account without one.

  `PushSubscription` gains an `organizationId` property and the
  `push_subscriptions` table gains a nullable `organization_id` column, a partial
  index on it, and
  `check ("customer_account_id" is null or "organization_id" is not null)`. The
  migration first derives the missing organisation from the account that owns each
  subscription, then refuses — with the count and up to twenty ids, deleting
  nothing — anything it could not derive. Unlike `comparisons`, this table carries
  **no foreign key** on `customer_account_id`, so that refusal is a branch a real
  database can reach.

  **What changes for a reader.** `PushSubscription` is `@CustomerScoped`, and the
  tenant filter's `allowed-set` arm consults the ORM's metadata for this column per
  query: an administrator whose authority is a set of organisations saw **no**
  subscribed device at all while the column was absent, and now sees the devices of
  the organisations they are assigned to. `GET /api/v1/admin/pwa/subscriptions`
  counts accordingly. The `meta.scopeNotice: 'ORGANIZATION_ATTRIBUTION_PENDING'`
  disclosure that explained that emptiness is no longer emitted for this table — it
  was keyed on the column's absence and retires with it. An **anonymous** device
  carries no organisation and is therefore outside every scoped administrator's
  reach; who such a device belongs to is an open product question and is not
  answered here.

  **What changes for a writer.** `PushSubscriptionService`'s constructor takes a
  `CustomerAccountReadPort` as its second argument — required, not optional — and
  `register` resolves the owning account's organisation before it touches the row.

  ```diff
  -new PushSubscriptionService(emFactory)
  +new PushSubscriptionService(emFactory, customerAccounts)
  ```

  `register` is an upsert on `endpoint`, and the account and the organisation now
  move **together in both directions**: signing in on a subscribed device stamps
  both, and re-subscribing that same device with no session clears both. That
  second direction is not held by the constraint — an implication says nothing
  about a row with no account — so it is held by the service writing both columns
  from one resolved owner value, and by a test. `revoke`, `prune` and
  `statsForChannel` are unchanged.

  **What can break.** An insert or update that sets `customer_account_id` without
  setting `organization_id` now fails with a check violation. A fixture or an
  external writer that builds a subscription by hand is the case to look at.

  The constraint is an **implication**, not an equivalence: an anonymous device is
  a representable state (FR-023) and carries no organisation. No foreign key is
  added.

### Patch Changes

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.
