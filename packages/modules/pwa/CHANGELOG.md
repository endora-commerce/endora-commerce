### Minor Changes

- be5b3ce: `DELETE /api/v1/storefront/pwa/subscriptions` removes a push subscription only for the party
  that created it.

  The route took `{ endpoint }` and deleted the matching row for any caller. It now deletes it
  only for a caller that holds the subscription:

  - the request carries the subscription's own keys, `{ endpoint, keys: { p256dh, auth } }` — the
    object the browser sent when it subscribed, compared in constant time. This is enough whoever
    is or is not signed in, so a signed-out browser can still remove its own subscription;
  - or the subscription belongs to a customer account and the request carries that customer's
    session, which needs no keys.

  The answer is `204` in every case, as it already was for an unknown endpoint, so it does not say
  whether an endpoint is registered.

  `POST /api/v1/storefront/pwa/subscriptions` updates an endpoint that is already registered only
  for that same party.

  The route upserted on `endpoint`: any caller could send new keys for a registered endpoint and
  the row took them, together with the caller's account or none. An existing row is now updated
  only on the same proof — the row's current keys in the request, or the owning customer's
  session. So:

  - the same browser subscribing again with unchanged keys is `200` with the same `id`, as before;
  - a signed-in customer subscribing a device with its keys takes the row — an anonymous one, or
    one another customer subscribed on that browser — and the account and organisation move
    together (`200`). This answered `409` or `500` before, because the lookup ran in the
    customer's tenant scope and did not see the row;
  - a signed-out browser subscribing again with its keys detaches the row from the account, the
    organisation going with it (`200`), as before;
  - new keys for an endpoint a customer owns are accepted from that customer's session (`200`);
  - anything else — keys that are not the row's, without the owner's session — is answered `201`
    with a fresh `id`, exactly like a first subscribe, and writes nothing. That includes an
    anonymous browser whose keys changed for the same endpoint: it is not re-keyed, and the stale
    row goes when the push service reports it gone.

  The answer to a refused request is the answer to a first subscribe for one request. A caller
  that repeats it is answered `201` again, where a row of its own would answer `200`.

  **Breaking for a custom storefront client**: an unsubscribe that sends the endpoint alone, with
  no session of the owning customer, is now a no-op. Send the keys from `PushSubscription.toJSON()` with it. The bundled
  storefront's `unsubscribeFromPush()` does so already; an instance that copied
  `storefront/lib/api/pwa.ts` should take the same change.

  The lookup by `endpoint`, and nothing else, runs under a system tenant scope in both routes;
  ownership is then checked explicitly.

  `PushSubscriptionDeleteSchema` (`@endora-commerce/contracts`) gains the optional `keys` object,
  and `PushSubscriptionService.revoke` takes a second argument naming the caller's session
  account and the presented keys.

## 0.103.0

### Patch Changes

- dfe3eeb: `POST /api/v1/admin/pwa/icon` can be reached. The route accepts `multipart/form-data` only, and
  the module registered no multipart parser, so every upload was refused before the handler ran and
  answered `500 INTERNAL`. The route now registers `@fastify/multipart` in a context of its own, so
  the parser reaches no other route of the module. An upload larger than `PWA_ICON_MAX_BYTES` (5 MB,
  exported from the module's admin routes) is refused as `400 PWA_ICON_INVALID`; what an icon may be
  — PNG or WebP, square, at least 512 pixels — is unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- 489a0b6: Documentation: migrations are now named by the file that actually ships. The pages cited
  migrations by a retired numbering (`024_settings_init.ts`, "migration 102", `080_returns_init.ts`
  and others), which matches no file in any package. Each reference now gives the real
  timestamped filename, such as `20260611T140346_catalog_product_value_overrides_init.ts`, and
  says which module owns it where that is a different module. The organizations page also no
  longer claims that the `suspended` → `blocked` migration writes an audit-log entry: it writes
  an explanatory `blocked_reason` on each remapped row.

## 0.101.1

### Patch Changes

- 69a3717: The `fastify` peer is now `^5.11.0` instead of `^5`, so an install can no longer resolve Fastify 5.0–5.10. On those versions an async route handler that calls `reply.send()` without `return` throws `ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT` as an uncaught exception from Fastify's onSend hook runner, and the process crash-loops; Fastify 5.11.0 catches that error and the server keeps running. An instance scaffolded by `endora new instance` now declares `fastify@^5.11.0` as well. Nothing to do on upgrade unless your project pins Fastify below 5.11 — move it to `^5.11.0` (the repository itself runs 5.12.5).

  `CHANGELOG.md` entry, with no change to what that entry says about the code.

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- 8f61a6b: Every published package now ships its own `LICENSE` and `README.md`.

  npm force-includes a file named `LICENSE` into the tarball exactly as it does `README.md`,
  whatever `files` says, so the text has to be in the package directory and not only at the
  repository root — `LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md` states that rule and, until this release, no package
  obeyed it. Measured on `master`: **0** of the 82 publishable packages carried a `LICENSE` and
  **14** carried a `README.md`, so every tarball shipped without licence text and 68 registry
  pages would have rendered empty.

  Both files are **generated**, by `pnpm --filter backend run manifests:generate`, and refused
  when stale by `manifests:check` in the `quality` job:
  - the `LICENSE` is the repository's root `LICENSE`, copied verbatim — the same single source
    the `license: MIT` field is already rendered from. A package that declares a licence of its
    own in the `SEE LICENSE IN <file>` form is skipped and keeps the file it names.
  - the `README.md` is rendered from what the package's own manifest declares: its description,
    its module id where it has one, every published subpath with what that layer holds, its peer
    dependencies with the optional ones marked, the locales its `i18n/` carries and what the
    tarball ships. A `README.md` **without** the generated marker on its first line is a human's
    and is never rewritten — the fourteen that existed are untouched.

  Five module packages also get their npm description back. `@endora-commerce/mod-blog`,
  `mod-credit-limits`, `mod-dhl-parcel`, `mod-google-analytics` and `mod-quote-requests` carried
  the note written when they were moved out of `backend/src/modules` — _"the first module to
  leave backend/src/modules … the manifest id stays identity of record"_ — as the sentence a
  registry shows under the package name. Each now carries the sentence its own module manifest
  declares, which is where `descriptionFor` seeds one from in the first place.

  No API changes, no new dependency, no behaviour change: what moves is what the tarball carries
  and what a package page says.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 0eeb9b5: Require Node >= 22.18.0.

  The previous floor was 22.17.0, which MikroORM 7 sets. 22.18.0 is the first release that
  strips TypeScript types without a flag, and that is what loads a deployment's overlay module:
  in a scaffolded instance `apps/` is outside every compiled member, so the unit the platform
  `import()`s is the client's own `.ts`. On 22.17.x that import throws
  `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` and the process dies before it listens. Emitting a `.js` beside
  the client's source was measured and refused — the overlay loader resolves `.js` before `.ts`
  while the divergence derivation admits both, so the sibling doubles every seam site in the
  report.

  Derived by probing 22.17.0, 22.17.1, 22.18.0 and 22.19.0 against a `.ts` module imported with
  no flag; 22.18.0 is the lowest that loads it.

  If you run 22.17.x, upgrade to 22.18 or later. Nothing else in these packages changed.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 02838b7: Nine modules now declare the environment inputs they own, in `manifest.env`, so a
  client who installs them can be told what to put in their `.env`. Each declaration
  carries an English and a Polish sentence, a requirement, and — for an `optional`
  one — what is lost without it.

  `health_checks` was the tenth until D-229 dissolved it into the platform; its two
  declarations went with it, and `search`'s `MEILISEARCH_URL` went with them,
  because the platform now declares that name and a module may not describe a
  platform input a second time.

  Nothing changes at runtime: no module reads a new variable and none changes how it
  reads an existing one. What changes is that the requirement is now on the wire, in
  the manifest the platform already carries, and reaches a consumer through the
  package's own `exports` map.

  Every module here declares only what it **owns**. The seven platform-owned names
  these modules read — `NODE_ENV`, `BACKEND_ROLE`, `STOREFRONT_BASE_URL`,
  `PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`, `BACKEND_PUBLIC_URL`, `REVALIDATE_SECRET` and
  `SETTINGS_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` — are declared by `@endora-commerce/platform` and
  are deliberately not repeated here.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- e27bf6c: Every package that ships scannable UI now publishes its own Tailwind `@source`
  declarations at a new `./tailwind.css` subpath.

  A host compiling this package's utility classes no longer has to know where the
  package's sources are. Import the subpath from the stylesheet that builds your
  admin, and the package names its own layers:

  ```css
  @import 'tailwindcss';
  @import '@endora-commerce/mod-blog/tailwind.css';
  ```

  `@source` resolves relative to the stylesheet that declares it, so the paths hold
  wherever the package is installed. The file is generated from the package's layer
  inventory, ships in the tarball beside `package.json`, and its `dist` line is the one
  that matters to you — the `src` line beside it is inert in a published package and
  exists so that a checkout of this repository keeps scanning source in `dev`.

  **Nothing is removed or renamed**: every existing subpath resolves exactly as before.
  What is new is the obligation on the _host_ side, and it is a build error rather than a
  silent one. Before this, a host reached these packages with a glob over the monorepo
  (`@source "../../packages/**"`), which named a directory no installed tree has —
  and Tailwind reports nothing at all about a source that matches nothing, so such a host
  built green and rendered every screen unstyled. A host that now names a package that is
  not installed gets `Can't resolve`, and one whose tarball omits the file gets
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.

  `@endora-commerce/cms-components` deliberately does **not** publish this subpath. It
  ships a finished, prefixed stylesheet at `./styles.css` and must not also be scanned by
  its host.

- 74f9777: Removed the `PwaBridge` interface and the `pwaBridge` container name; `pwa` resolves its
  cross-module dependencies itself.

  **If you composed this module**, delete your `pwaBridge` contribution. There is no
  replacement name and nothing to supply: `registerModule` now resolves
  `assetsLibraryPort`, the kernel's `salesChannelResolutionPort` and `orderReadPort` through
  `lazyPort`, reads the platform's `adminAuditActorResolver` from the cradle, and reads
  `request.actor` for the calling customer. `pwaRunWorkers` is unchanged and is still the
  one thing a composition supplies for this module.

  Two option changes come with it, both on `PwaModuleOptions` (which is internal to the
  package and reachable only through `./backend`):
  - `resolveChannelIdByCode` is **deleted**. Nothing called it: the three storefront routes
    read the platform's resolved request channel, so the option, the dependency field it
    was threaded into and the two closures that built it were dead the whole way down.
  - `resolveOrderTarget` is now **required**, because the module resolves `orderReadPort`
    itself and no composition can decline to supply it. `resolveQuoteTarget` stays optional
    and is still supplied by nobody.

  `orders` joins the manifest `dependencies`. It is binding and costs no operator a
  control: `orders` declares `nonDeactivatable`.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 21dac4f: `dictionaries`, `settings` and `credentials` ship their admin surfaces, and a module can
  publish a React component to another module for the first time.

  **New `./admin` subpath on four packages.** `@endora-commerce/mod-dictionaries`,
  `@endora-commerce/mod-settings` and `@endora-commerce/mod-credentials` each export
  `contributions` — an `AdminContributions` object — from `@endora-commerce/mod-<id>/admin`,
  and nothing else. `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa` already exported one and it grows a `routes`
  entry. Nine routes and ten nav entries in total, all at the paths and codes the
  hand-written host registrations carried:
  - `mod-dictionaries` — `/dictionary`, `/dictionaries/audit` and `/admin/dictionaries/audit`,
    all `dictionary.write`; sidebar rows for `/dictionary` and `/admin/dictionaries/audit`.
  - `mod-settings` — `/settings` and `/settings/groups` on `settings:read`, `/settings/cache`
    on `settings:write`; a sidebar row for each.
  - `mod-credentials` — `/credentials` on `credentials:read` and `/credentials/new` on
    `credentials:write`; one sidebar row.
  - `mod-pwa` — `/settings/pwa` on `pwa:read`, beside the sidebar row it has declared since
    the previous wave. `PwaPage`, `PushAudienceRuleBuilder` and the `pwa` admin API client
    moved into this package from `mod-settings`' directory, where they had been since before
    either was a package.

  Route components are dynamic-import factories, so a consumer's bundler emits one chunk per
  screen, and every screen resolves its design system through `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`.

  **New `./admin-ui` subpath on `@endora-commerce/mod-credentials`, and it is a new kind of
  subpath.** It exports `ConfigurationPreviewModal` and its `ConfigurationPreviewModalProps` —
  a read-only view of one credential configuration with every secret masked, taking
  `{ open, configuration, onClose }`. This is the first package in the repository to publish a
  React component to another package rather than to the admin application, and three things
  about it are contract rather than convenience:
  - **It is not the kit.** A component whose rendering is generic over its data belongs in
    `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`; this one calls `useTranslation('credentials')`, so every
    string it shows is the owner's vocabulary and the kit refuses it.
  - **A consumer gates presence itself.** `credentials` carries an operator activation
    control, and a statically imported component is filtered by nothing — so the consumer
    wraps the render in `useSurfaceVisibility()({ module: 'credentials' })`. With the module
    switched off the caller must render nothing rather than a modal over an API that answers 503.
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-credentials` becomes a peer dependency of
    `@endora-commerce/mod-settings`.** The reach survives into emitted JavaScript, so a
    consumer that bundles `mod-settings`' admin layer has to resolve the owner.

  **`@endora-commerce/admin-kit`:** `toAbsoluteAssetUrl` now trims its argument and returns a
  protocol-relative URL (`//cdn.example.com/x.png`) unchanged. It previously prefixed such a
  URL with the API origin, producing `https://api.example.com//cdn.example.com/x.png`, which
  loads nothing. Existing callers passing an absolute, `data:`, `blob:` or host-relative URL
  are unaffected. `resolveIcon` answers for two more names, `Languages` and `Eraser`.

  **`@endora-commerce/contracts`:** `KnownIconNameSchema` gains `'Languages'` and `'Eraser'`.
  Additive — no previously valid icon name is rejected.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`:** ten `appShell.*` keys are **removed** from the shared
  bundle — `appShell.nav.{cache,credentials,dictionary,dictionaryAudit,settingGroups,settings}`
  and `appShell.palette.sub.{credentials,dictionary,dictionaryAudit,platformConfiguration}`.
  Their replacements are `nav.*.label` keys in the three modules' own bundles, resolved in each
  module's own namespace. **A consumer rendering one of those ten keys by hand will render the
  raw key**; there is no compatibility alias, because a key with one consumer in two bundles is
  the duplication this feature removes.

  **Both shipped languages, everywhere.** Every new key — the six `nav.*.label`s,
  `mod-settings`' `editor.credentialRef.preview` and `mod-dictionaries`' four
  `actions.openDictionary*` strings — ships in `en` and `pl`.

  **`mod-dictionaries` declares two command-palette actions**, `open-dictionary` and
  `open-dictionary-audit`, both on `dictionary.write`. They replace hand-written rows in the
  admin's own palette table, so what an operator sees is unchanged; what changes is that the
  server now filters them against the effective enabled-set, which the hand-written rows were
  never asked about.

  **Build.** `./admin` resolves at `dist/admin/index.js` and `./admin-ui` at
  `dist/admin-ui/index.js`, both emitted by each package's `tsconfig.ui.json`. A checkout that
  has not run `pnpm run build:packages` cannot resolve either. All four packages' `build` and
  `typecheck` scripts now run two `tsc` invocations, and `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`, `react`,
  `react-router-dom` and `lucide-react` become peer dependencies where a screen names them.

- fc34995: `pwa` ships an admin surface that is a sidebar entry and nothing else.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa/admin` is a new subpath exporting `contributions` — an
  `AdminContributions` object with **one `nav` entry and no `routes`**. That combination is
  legal and was, until now, unexercised: the type's own documentation says _"a module shipping
  only a nav entry pointing at a host route is legal"_, and every conversion before this one
  moved a route. The entry advertises `/settings/pwa`, labelled `nav.pwa.label` in this
  package's own `i18n/{en,pl}.json` rather than in the shared bundle, in section `system` at
  weight 1400, gated on `pwa:read`.

  Two things a consumer has to know:
  - **The screen at that path is not in this package.** `PwaPage` lives in the admin
    application, under a directory `settings` owns, so the route is still declared by the host.
    A consumer that renders the registry's nav without the admin's own route table will show an
    entry pointing at a path it does not serve. That resolves when `settings` ships its own
    admin layer.
  - **`Smartphone` joins the icon allowlist.** `KnownIconNameSchema` gains the name and the
    kit's `resolveIcon` maps it to the lucide component of that name — the pair AGENTS.md's
    command-palette checklist requires in one merge request, because a name on the allowlist
    with no entry in the map renders the generic `Sparkles` fallback. It is added rather than
    substituted so the sidebar keeps the glyph it already drew.

- 661e80d: Fourteen new packages: the **second** batch of modules to leave `backend/src/modules/`
  (feature 080, T040b). Five moved one at a time, then ten together; these fourteen are the
  same shape as the ten, and the properties below hold fourteen times over.

  **One changeset, not fourteen**, for the reason batch one gives: a changeset is written for
  the consumer of a package, and a package that did not exist a moment ago has no upgrader to
  instruct. What genuinely differs per package is its layer inventory, and that is the table.

  Every subpath is compiled output (D-164); none has a root wildcard; each package's `.` is
  its `manifest.ts`, where the generated manifest index reads the module's identity, its
  `dependencies`, its permission codes, its command-palette actions, its settings and its
  activation control.

  **`./backend` publishes `registerModule(ctx)` and an `entities` array, and no entity class by
  name** (D-168) — type-only exports included, which this batch measured rather than assumed:
  two packages published their entities' row types so the dev seed could name them, and
  `module-package-entity-surface.test.ts` refused both, in as many words — _"that is the one
  thing that makes a foreign module's `import type { … }` compile"_. The exports are gone and
  the seed takes each class off the published array by name.

  **One of the fourteen owns no table and says so with an empty array rather than by
  omission.** `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels` exports `entities: readonly never[] = []`.
  The distinction is not cosmetic: the platform's package loader answers a _missing_ export
  with `[]`, so "this module has no table" and "somebody forgot the array" would otherwise
  arrive as one silence, whose only symptom is a query against a table nobody created.

  **One package publishes a type on `./backend` that is not an entity**, and it is there
  because a composition root has to name a contribution it supplies:
  `@endora-commerce/mod-shopping-lists` re-exports `ShoppingListService`. A root cannot reach
  a package's internal file — `rootDir` makes a relative specifier into `packages/` TS6059
  even for an `import type` — so a contribution shape has to be on a published subpath or it
  is unnameable.

  **Two packages declare a `@fastify/*` dependency nothing imports.**
  `@endora-commerce/mod-mfa` peers on `@fastify/cookie` and `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa` on
  `@fastify/multipart`, because `reply.setCookie`, `request.isMultipart()` and
  `request.file()` are declaration-merging augmentations rather than imports. Inside the
  application those arrived ambiently through the host's own dependency; a package compiles
  against its own manifest, where an unnamed dependency does not exist. Both write
  `import type {} from '@fastify/…'`, which is type-only: the plugin is still the host's to
  register.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter` and `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa` also carry a companion
  `@types/*` in `devDependencies`** — `@types/nodemailer` and `@types/web-push` — which the
  manifest generator now derives. Nothing imports a `@types` package; the compiler finds it
  through `node_modules/@types`, which inside a package is the package's own declaration, so
  a module importing a JS-only library did not build until this landed.

- e12188d: `pwa` gains `organization_id` on `push_subscriptions`, stamps it on every owned
  write, clears it with the account, and refuses a row that names a customer
  account without one.

  `PushSubscription` gains an `organizationId` property and the
  `push_subscriptions` table gains a nullable `organization_id` column, a partial
  index on it, and
  `check ("customer_account_id" is null or "organization_id" is not null)`. The
  migration first derives the missing organisation from the account that owns each
  subscription, then refuses — with the count and up to twenty ids, deleting
  nothing — anything it could not derive. Unlike `comparisons`, this table carries
  **no foreign key** on `customer_account_id`, so that refusal is a branch a real
  database can reach.

  **What changes for a reader.** `PushSubscription` is `@CustomerScoped`, and the
  tenant filter's `allowed-set` arm consults the ORM's metadata for this column per
  query: an administrator whose authority is a set of organisations saw **no**
  subscribed device at all while the column was absent, and now sees the devices of
  the organisations they are assigned to. `GET /api/v1/admin/pwa/subscriptions`
  counts accordingly. The `meta.scopeNotice: 'ORGANIZATION_ATTRIBUTION_PENDING'`
  disclosure that explained that emptiness is no longer emitted for this table — it
  was keyed on the column's absence and retires with it. An **anonymous** device
  carries no organisation and is therefore outside every scoped administrator's
  reach; who such a device belongs to is an open product question and is not
  answered here.

  **What changes for a writer.** `PushSubscriptionService`'s constructor takes a
  `CustomerAccountReadPort` as its second argument — required, not optional — and
  `register` resolves the owning account's organisation before it touches the row.

  ```diff
  -new PushSubscriptionService(emFactory)
  +new PushSubscriptionService(emFactory, customerAccounts)
  ```

  `register` is an upsert on `endpoint`, and the account and the organisation now
  move **together in both directions**: signing in on a subscribed device stamps
  both, and re-subscribing that same device with no session clears both. That
  second direction is not held by the constraint — an implication says nothing
  about a row with no account — so it is held by the service writing both columns
  from one resolved owner value, and by a test. `revoke`, `prune` and
  `statsForChannel` are unchanged.

  **What can break.** An insert or update that sets `customer_account_id` without
  setting `organization_id` now fails with a check violation. A fixture or an
  external writer that builds a subscription by hand is the case to look at.

  The constraint is an **implication**, not an equivalence: an anonymous device is
  a representable state (FR-023) and carries no organisation. No foreign key is
  added.

### Patch Changes

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.
