### Minor Changes

- 73d0887: Publish `MfaEnrolmentStatePort`, and make `twoFactorEnabled` the live enrolment.

  `activeSubjectIds(subjectType: MfaSubjectType, subjectIds: readonly string[]):
Promise<string[]>` answers which of the given subjects hold an active second
  factor, on the `mfaEnrolmentStatePort` container. Batched rather than per row,
  because every caller is a list surface; the answer is plain ids, because
  `MfaEnrolment` carries the encrypted TOTP secret and no consumer has business
  holding it.

  New surface on `mfa` — nothing is removed there. A consumer resolves it with
  `lazyPort<MfaEnrolmentStatePort>(ctx, 'mfaEnrolmentStatePort')` and declares the
  edge; both consumers in this repository declare it `degrades-without`, because
  `mfa` is deactivatable and a locked consumer binding it would make the operator's
  MFA switch a dead one.

  **Two mappers gained a required parameter, and that is a breaking change to a
  call, not to a wire shape.** `toAdminUserRecord(admin, twoFactorEnabled)` and
  `toCustomerAccountRecord(account, twoFactorEnabled)` no longer derive the field
  themselves; each package also exports a batching helper
  (`toAdminUserRecords` / `toCustomerAccountRecords`, plus
  `toOneCustomerAccountRecord`) that takes the reader and does one `mfa` read per
  response. The parameter has no default deliberately: it replaces a derivation
  that was silently wrong, and a default would let the next call site reintroduce
  it. Two service constructors take the reader as a new argument —
  `CustomerAccountReadService(emFactory, twoFactorEnrolments)` and
  `AdminUserReadService(emFactory, twoFactorEnrolments)`, with the same addition on
  `CustomerAccountMemberWriteService`, `CustomerAccountLifecycleWriteService` and
  `CustomerAccountAdminSearchService`.

  `twoFactorEnabled: boolean` is unchanged on every response and on both published
  records; what changed is where the value comes from. It was
  `Boolean(x.twoFactorConfirmedAt)` — a column with no writer on either identity
  table, whose last non-null writer was the superseded customer TOTP path deleted
  on 2026-08-25 — so the field was a provably constant `false`. `/admin-users`
  reported no second factor for an administrator who had enrolled an hour earlier,
  and `GET /api/v1/me/customer` told a buyer their own account was unprotected
  while it was not.

  `two_factor_confirmed_at` is now read by nothing on either table. Dropping the
  two columns is a separate migration and is not in this change.

- 4013a8b: `promotions`, `payment_methods`, `customer_accounts` and `product_feeds` ship their admin
  surfaces, on a new `./admin` subpath each; `KnownIconNameSchema` gains one member and the kit's
  icon map the glyph behind it.

  Each of the four module packages now exports `contributions` from
  `@endora-commerce/mod-<id>/admin` as an `AdminContributions` object whose every component is a
  dynamic-import factory, so a consumer's bundler emits one chunk per screen and none of it is
  downloaded by an operator who cannot reach it. Seventeen routes and eight sidebar entries move,
  and not one of the routes changes its path: `/promotions`, `/promotions/new`, `/promotions/:id`,
  `/promotions/:id/stats` and `/promotion-rules`; `/payment-methods`; `/customer-groups`; and the
  ten `/product-feeds*` paths.

  Six things a consumer has to know:
  - **The subpath is a new `exports` entry, so it needs a build.** `./admin` resolves at
    `dist/admin/index.js`, emitted by each package's new `tsconfig.ui.json`. A checkout that has
    not run `pnpm run build:packages` cannot resolve it.
  - **`@endora-commerce/admin-kit`, `react`, `lucide-react` and `react-router-dom` become peer
    dependencies of all four.** They were backend-only packages before this. The kit is where
    every screen's design-system import now resolves, and React is peered rather than depended on
    so the application resolves one copy.
  - **Every route carries a `requiredPermission`, and the admin enforces it.** `promotions:read`
    for all five promotion routes, `payment_methods:read`, `customer_groups:read` and
    `product_feeds:read` — in each case the code the screen's own API enforces on its entry
    handler. A host `<Route>` was ungated, so a consumer who deep-links one of these paths for an
    operator without the code now gets the admin's not-found treatment where the screen used to
    render and its API answered 403. The write codes each of these modules also owns
    (`promotions:write`, `promotions:delete`, `payment_methods:write`, `customer_groups:write`,
    `product_feeds:write`) gate controls **inside** a screen and are unchanged.
  - **`KnownIconNameSchema` gains `PercentDiamond`.** A nav entry names its icon, and both of
    `promotions`' sidebar rows drew that glyph as a `lucide-react` import inside the admin's own
    `AppShell.tsx` until this change — so keeping the sidebar looking the same meant adding the
    name rather than substituting one already on the allowlist.
    `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`'s `resolveIcon` maps it. Widening a `z.enum` is additive for a
    producer and narrowing for a consumer that exhaustively switches on `KnownIconName`; nothing
    in this repository does. The other three modules needed nothing — `CreditCard`, `Users` and
    `Rss` are already on the list, each added by an earlier palette action of that same module.
  - **`@endora-commerce/mod-product-feeds` gains two sales-channel reads of its own.**
    `feedSalesChannelReads.list()` and `.getByCode()` on the module's admin client build
    `GET /api/v1/admin/sales-channels` requests from the published `apiClient` and the contract's
    own `SalesChannelListResponse` / `SalesChannelDetail`. The create form used to import
    `sales_channels`' admin client for the same two calls; duplicating one HTTP call is
    deliberate, because the only place two modules could share it is the admin kit and the kit
    holds no module knowledge.
  - **`product_feeds`' download anchors now read the API origin from
    `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`'s `apiBaseUrl`.** They read `import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL`
    directly before, with a `''` fallback — same-origin, which in a dev tree is the Vite server
    and has no API behind it. The kit's fallback is `http://localhost:3001`. Whenever the
    variable is set the two are identical, so this is a repair to the unset case and not a change
    to any configured one.

  Each of the four modules' nav labels move out of the shared `_i18n` bundle into the package's
  own `i18n/`, under module-relative keys (`nav.promotions.label`, `nav.promotionRules.label`,
  `nav.paymentMethods.label`, `nav.customerGroups.label`, `nav.productFeeds.label`). One shared
  key is deliberately kept: `appShell.nav.paymentMethods` is still the parent crumb of five
  breadcrumb trails the admin holds for the payment-gateway settings screens.

  Nothing is removed and no existing export changes shape, so a consumer of any of the four
  `./backend`, `./migrations`, `./ports` or root subpaths is unaffected.

- 7af67c0: Declared as `peerDependencies` the packages these seven already publish types from (D-181).

  Each of them emits a `.d.ts` that imports a specifier its manifest declared only as a
  `devDependency`, which a consumer's install does not resolve. The consequence is silent:
  the type becomes `any`, and under `skipLibCheck: true` — what `tsc --init` writes — there
  is **no diagnostic at all**. Measured on `@endora-commerce/mod-catalog` with
  `@endora-commerce/mod-custom-fields` not installed: the exported
  `CatalogCradle.customFieldDefinitionService` typed as `any`, clean compile; with it
  installed, the correct `CustomFieldDefinitionApplyApi` and a refused assignment.

  Eleven peers, in two shapes:
  - **A published port interface of another module package** — `mod-catalog` →
    `mod-custom-fields`, `mod-customer-accounts` → `mod-organizations`, `mod-orders` →
    `mod-carts` / `mod-credit-limits` / `mod-inventory` / `mod-invoices` / `mod-promotions`,
    `mod-payments` → `mod-orders`. All are `import type … from '<pkg>/ports'` and all appear
    in the emitted declarations, so a consumer type-checking the package resolves them.
  - **A `@types/*` companion whose library reaches the declarations** — `@types/pdfmake`
    for `mod-invoices` and `mod-comparisons` (`pdfmake/interfaces.js` has no types without
    it), `@types/ssh2-sftp-client` for `mod-product-feeds`.

  **If you install one of these packages**, its peers are now install-time requirements
  rather than something your own tree happened to provide. `@types/nodemailer` and
  `@types/web-push` are deliberately _not_ among them: their libraries are imported inside
  function bodies and reach no published signature. Neither is `@types/react` or any other
  types package that contributes global declarations — those exist once in a program by
  construction, and forcing our copy is a conflict you could not fix.

  `minor` rather than `major`: nothing here changes an exported symbol or a call, and the
  requirement is one a consumer that type-checks these packages already had to satisfy for
  the types to mean anything. It is more than a patch because a resolver that was silently
  succeeding will now report an unmet peer.

- 44d0ec3: `customer_accounts` and `inventory` become workspace packages (feature 080,
  T040b, batch six). Each ships `dist` and resolves through its own `exports`
  map — the root for its manifest, `./backend` for `registerModule` plus the
  `entities` array, `./migrations` for its migration classes, and, for
  `inventory`, a type-only `./ports` — exactly as the fifty-nine packages before
  them.

  **`./backend` publishes the `entities` array and no entity class by name**
  (D-168). A consumer that needs `CustomerAccount`, `CustomerGroup` or
  `PasswordResetToken` as a runtime class takes it off that array by name:

  ```ts
  import { entities } from '@endora-commerce/mod-customer-accounts/backend';
  import { entityNamed } from '<host>/packages/package-entity-lookup.js';

  const CustomerAccount = entityNamed<CustomerAccountRow>(
    entities,
    'CustomerAccount',
    '@endora-commerce/mod-customer-accounts/backend',
  );
  ```

  The `CustomerAccountsCradle` type moves with it and is named at
  `@endora-commerce/mod-customer-accounts/backend`.

  **This is the first package to declare another module package as a
  devDependency.** `@endora-commerce/mod-organizations` is reached only by
  `import type` at `@endora-commerce/mod-organizations/ports`, whose emitted
  module exports no runtime binding, so the manifest generator renders it into
  `devDependencies` at `workspace:*` and leaves `peerDependencies` alone (R4 as
  narrowed for contract surface). Nothing of `organizations` appears in this
  package's emitted `.js`; the implementation is still resolved at runtime through
  the container name `personalOrganizationProvisionPort`, so the gate that answers
  503 `MODULE_DISABLED` when `organizations` is switched off is the registration
  and not a call anybody has to remember to write.

  No exported symbol changed shape. What changed is where a consumer names it.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-inventory` publishes a `./ports` subpath.** It is
  type-only: `tsc` emits `export {};`, and it is where a consumer names
  `InventoryReservationApplyPort` instead of reaching into the owner's directory.

  ```ts
  import type { InventoryReservationApplyPort } from '@endora-commerce/mod-inventory/ports';
  ```

  **It also publishes two runtime bindings by name on `./backend`**, beside the
  `entities` array: `WarehouseChannelReconciler` and `DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE_ID`. D-168
  keeps entity classes off that door; a service and a constant are not entities,
  and the development catalog seed must hold the _same_ reconciler the platform
  composed rather than a second copy evaluated from source (D-160.6.1) — the shape
  `price_lists` already ships as `DefaultPriceListMigrator` / `DEFAULT_PRICE_LIST_ID`.

  No exported symbol changed shape. What changed is where a consumer names it.

### Patch Changes

- 5d9bb88: Error-code ownership: Tier B's six already-bundled modules declare the codes they own, and eight
  placeholder sentences leave the platform bundle.

  `manifest.errorCodes` gains seven codes on `@endora-commerce/mod-customer-accounts`
  (`ACCOUNT_BLOCKED`, `CANNOT_DEMOTE_LAST_ADMIN`, `CANNOT_REMOVE_LAST_ADMIN` and the four
  `CUSTOMER_*` record codes), six on `@endora-commerce/mod-catalog` (`BULK_TOO_LARGE`, the three
  `PACKAGING_UNIT_*` codes, `SELECTION_TOO_LARGE`, `SYSTEM_ATTRIBUTE_SET_IMMUTABLE`), three on
  `@endora-commerce/mod-orders` (`CURRENCY_MISMATCH`, `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REQUIRED`,
  `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED`), two on `@endora-commerce/mod-mfa` (`TWO_FACTOR_REQUIRED`,
  `TWO_FACTOR_REQUIRED_BY_ROLE`), one on `@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter`
  (`ALREADY_SUBSCRIBED`) and one on `@endora-commerce/mod-promotions` (`PROMOTION_INVALID`);
  `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n` drops the same twenty from its own declaration, which is what
  decides where the error envelope looks for a sentence (D-129's remaining sweep, MR 4 of eight;
  D-121 tiers T1 and T2; D-186 §1 and §2 in `specs/080-f4-real-scope/rulings.md`;
  `specs/090-module-owned-error-codes/d129-sweep.md`).

  `@endora-commerce/mod-customer-accounts`, `@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-promotions` declare an error code for the first time. No wire shape moves:
  `error.code` is unchanged for all twenty.

  **Eight sentences are deleted from `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`'s bundle, and this is
  operator-visible.** Each was the error code rewritten twice — `"Currency Mismatch."` in `en` and
  `"Błąd: currency mismatch."` in `pl` — which D-186 §2 refuses to carry into a module's own
  bundle, where it would read as that module's answer rather than as an unwritten sentence. Four
  of the eight are replaced by real prose in both languages in the receiving module's own bundle:
  - `errors.SYSTEM_ATTRIBUTE_SET_IMMUTABLE` in `@endora-commerce/mod-catalog`
  - `errors.CANNOT_DEMOTE_LAST_ADMIN` and `errors.CANNOT_REMOVE_LAST_ADMIN` in
    `@endora-commerce/mod-customer-accounts`
  - `errors.CURRENCY_MISMATCH` in `@endora-commerce/mod-orders`

  The other four — `TWO_FACTOR_REQUIRED`, `TWO_FACTOR_REQUIRED_BY_ROLE`, `ALREADY_SUBSCRIBED` and
  `PROMOTION_INVALID` — are codes nothing in the platform raises, so there was no refusal to
  describe and the placeholder is deleted without a replacement. A consumer that reads those keys
  out of `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`'s bundle directly will no longer find them; nothing in the
  platform produced the codes they belonged to.
