## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- ad62954: Fourteen more modules become workspace packages (feature 080, T040b batch three):
  `autopay`, `comparisons`, `credentials`, `dictionaries`, `google_tag_manager`,
  `ksef`, `meta_ads`, `paypal`, `payu`, `quick_order`, `search`, `stripe`, `taxes`
  and `tpay`. Each ships `dist` and resolves through its own `exports` map — the
  root for its manifest, `./backend` for `registerModule` plus the `entities`
  array, `./migrations` for its migration classes — exactly as the twenty-nine
  packages before them.

  **For a consumer of `@endora-commerce/mod-ksef`, one export is new and
  load-bearing.** `KsefUnavailableError` is now published by name on `./backend`:

  ```ts
  import { KsefUnavailableError } from '@endora-commerce/mod-ksef/backend';
  ```

  Anything implementing `KsefApiClientPort` — an overlay's client, a test double,
  a second gateway — must throw **that** class for an outage.
  `classifySubmissionError` decides "retry" from `instanceof`, so a caller holding
  a constructor of its own, or the class from a relative import into this
  package's source, gets its outage classified as `UNEXPECTED`: the submission is
  parked for an operator instead of queued for the sweep, silently. There is no
  behaviour change for a caller that already throws the module's own class.

  Nothing else in any of the fourteen changed shape. The move is a relocation:
  same entities, same migrations, same class names, same tables. The committed
  migration registry's `(moduleId, className)` declaration sequence and its
  computed execution sequence are byte-identical to the merge base — 158 entries,
  `declaration=2db29d89…`, `execution=c794685f…` — because packaging changes no
  manifest `dependencies` and the order is a function of those.

### Patch Changes

- 6f5687c: These four packages now declare a `test` script and ship a `vitest.config.ts`, so the unit
  tests they already carried beside their sources are collected and run.

  They were not. `specs/deferred-defects.md`'s _"Co-located tests inside a module package run
  nowhere"_ is the entry this closes: no vitest configuration included `packages/**` and no
  module package declared a test command, so fifteen files across these four packages were
  collected by no run, reported by no job and counted in no total. They were not failing —
  as far as the pipeline was concerned they did not exist, which in review reads as coverage.
  All fifteen pass on first collection: 103 tests, and the CI job that will now run them,
  `test:frontend`, goes from 229 files / 1240 tests to 244 / 1343.

  **If you consume one of these packages**, nothing you import changes: `files` still ships
  `dist` and `i18n`, `tsconfig.build.json` still roots the emit at `src/`, and the test files
  and the configuration are in neither. The only difference is that `pnpm test` inside the
  package now does something.

  **If you write a module package**, two rules now hold and are enforced rather than
  documented:
  - The generated `test` script is a bare `vitest run` — never `--passWithNoTests`. Measured
    on vitest 2.1.9 over a package with no test file, bare `run` exits 1 with _"No test files
    found"_ and the flag turns that into 0. A package that declares a runner and collects
    nothing must fail, or the repair reproduces the defect it fixes.
  - `manifests:generate` and `manifests:check` **refuse** a package that holds a test file and
    declares no `vitest.config.ts`, naming the file. That is what stops the gap reopening
    silently for the next package.

  A package's `vitest.config.ts` must `mergeConfig` the repository root's
  `vitest.config.base.ts`: that is where issue #255's foreign-workspace-link refusal lives,
  and a configuration that skips it can execute another checkout's sources while reporting on
  this branch.
