### Minor Changes

- e27bf6c: Every package that ships scannable UI now publishes its own Tailwind `@source`
  declarations at a new `./tailwind.css` subpath.

  A host compiling this package's utility classes no longer has to know where the
  package's sources are. Import the subpath from the stylesheet that builds your
  admin, and the package names its own layers:

  ```css
  @import 'tailwindcss';
  @import '@endora-commerce/mod-blog/tailwind.css';
  ```

  `@source` resolves relative to the stylesheet that declares it, so the paths hold
  wherever the package is installed. The file is generated from the package's layer
  inventory, ships in the tarball beside `package.json`, and its `dist` line is the one
  that matters to you — the `src` line beside it is inert in a published package and
  exists so that a checkout of this repository keeps scanning source in `dev`.

  **Nothing is removed or renamed**: every existing subpath resolves exactly as before.
  What is new is the obligation on the _host_ side, and it is a build error rather than a
  silent one. Before this, a host reached these packages with a glob over the monorepo
  (`@source "../../packages/**"`), which named a directory no installed tree has —
  and Tailwind reports nothing at all about a source that matches nothing, so such a host
  built green and rendered every screen unstyled. A host that now names a package that is
  not installed gets `Can't resolve`, and one whose tarball omits the file gets
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.

  `@endora-commerce/cms-components` deliberately does **not** publish this subpath. It
  ships a finished, prefixed stylesheet at `./styles.css` and must not also be scanned by
  its host.

### Patch Changes

- 034f190: Both modules declare `demo: false` — a decision recorded rather than a field filled in.

  The demo shop holds seven product-host custom-field definitions and about five hundred assets,
  and not one of them is either module's own demo data. A product attribute is a definition paired
  1:1 with a `catalog` extension row and written in one call; every demo asset is minted inside a
  loop over `catalog`'s products, with its filename and its generated image derived from the
  product it hangs off, and its id handed straight to one of `catalog`'s tables. Each is two
  modules' rows in one statement and belongs to whoever owns the instance.

  For `custom_fields` this also settles a question the feature's own artefacts left open, and
  settles it against the proposal: the definitions cannot be seeded here with the extension rows
  seeded by `catalog`, because `catalog` would then have to read `custom_field_definitions` to find
  the id its extension references, and a module's demo body may not read another module's table.

  Absent and `false` are different states, so this changes no behaviour: it says the modules owe
  nothing rather than leaving it undecided.

### Minor Changes

- 27ca81d: `assets_library` and `custom_fields` ship their admin surfaces.

  **New `./admin` subpath on both packages.** `@endora-commerce/mod-assets-library` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-custom-fields` each export `contributions` — an `AdminContributions`
  object — from `@endora-commerce/mod-<id>/admin`, and nothing else. Each declares one route
  and one sidebar entry; the route components are dynamic-import factories, so a consumer's
  bundler emits one chunk per screen. The routes are unchanged: `/assets-library` and
  `/custom-fields`, gated on `assets.read` and `custom_fields:read` respectively — the codes
  the hand-written host registrations carried.

  Four things a consumer has to know about that half:
  - **The subpath needs a build.** `./admin` resolves at `dist/admin/index.js`, emitted by
    each package's new `tsconfig.ui.json`; a checkout that has not run
    `pnpm run build:packages` cannot resolve it. Both packages' `build` and `typecheck`
    scripts now run two `tsc` invocations.
  - **`@endora-commerce/admin-kit`, `react` and `lucide-react` become peer dependencies of
    both**, and `react-router-dom` of `mod-custom-fields`. The kit is where every screen's
    design-system import resolves; `react` is peered rather than depended on so the
    application resolves one copy.
  - **Each package's `i18n/` bundle gains its own `nav.*.label`** — `nav.assetsLibrary.label`
    and `nav.customFields.label` — resolved in the module's own namespace instead of the
    shared `core` one. `appShell.nav.assetsLibrary` and `appShell.nav.customFields` are
    removed from `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`'s bundle with the host rows that named them.
  - **`mod-custom-fields`' screen no longer reads the `core` namespace at all.** It rendered
    `customFields.title` and `customFields.description` out of the shared bundle beside four
    keys of its own; both were already written in this package's `i18n/{en,pl}.json`, so the
    shared reads were a second copy of two strings. `customFields.title` and
    `customFields.save` stay in `mod-i18n` because `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`'s
    `CustomFieldValuesPanel` renders them.

  **One repair inside `mod-assets-library`, and it is a deduplication a consumer can see.**
  `AssetDetailDrawer` carried a private `toAbsoluteAssetUrl` over its own
  `import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL` read with a `http://localhost:3001` fallback — a
  fourteenth copy of the function `@endora-commerce/admin-kit/lib` publishes. It takes the
  kit's now, which is the binding `LibraryPage` two files away was already taking. There is
  one implementation of it in the tree again.

  **Nothing is removed and no existing export changes shape**, so a consumer of either
  package's `./backend`, `./migrations`, `./ports` or root subpath is unaffected. Both
  modules declare `activation.nonDeactivatable`, so neither gains an operator-facing switch:
  what the new subpath adds is where the screens live, not whether they can be withdrawn.

- e637f56: Seven more modules become workspace packages (feature 080, T040b batch four):
  `assets_library`, `carts`, `custom_fields`, `customers`, `email`, `invoices` and
  `settings`. Each ships `dist` and resolves through its own `exports` map — the
  root for its manifest, `./backend` for `registerModule` plus the `entities`
  array, `./migrations` for its migration classes where it owns any — exactly as
  the forty-three packages before them.

  Three things a consumer of one of these packages should know.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-carts`, `@endora-commerce/mod-custom-fields` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-invoices` publish a `./ports` subpath.** It is type-only:
  `tsc` emits `export {};`, and it is where a consumer names
  `CartPlacementApplyPort`, `CustomFieldDefinitionApplyApi` and
  `InvoicePlacementApplyPort` instead of reaching into the owner's directory.

  ```ts
  import type { CartPlacementApplyPort } from '@endora-commerce/mod-carts/ports';
  ```

  The implementations stay behind their container names
  (`cartPlacementApplyPort`, `customFieldDefinitionApplyApi`,
  `invoicePlacementApplyPort`) and are resolved with `lazyPort`, never through
  this subpath.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-settings` declares `entities` as an empty array.** The
  module owns no table — the settings store is the platform's — and the empty
  array is the statement, because the host reads a _missing_ export as `[]` and a
  forgotten one would be indistinguishable from an honest none.

  **No entity class is exported by name from any of the seven**, `import type`
  included (D-168). A consumer that must construct one takes it off the published
  `entities` array by name; `Cart`, `Invoice` and the rest are deliberately not
  importable.

### Patch Changes

- 3786732: Error-code ownership: the rest of Tier A is declared by the modules that own its nouns.

  `manifest.errorCodes` gains six codes on `@endora-commerce/mod-prompt-actions`
  (`ASSISTANT_*`, `PROMPT_*`), five on `@endora-commerce/mod-custom-fields` (`CUSTOM_FIELD_*`),
  two on `@endora-commerce/mod-customers` (`CUSTOMER_ADDRESS_NOT_FOUND`,
  `REGISTRATION_REQUIRES_ORGANIZATION`), two on `@endora-commerce/mod-shopping-lists`
  (`SHOPPING_LIST_*`), one on `@endora-commerce/mod-price-lists` (`PRICE_LIST_NOT_FOUND`) and one
  on `@endora-commerce/mod-transactional-emails` (`TRANSACTIONAL_EMAIL_NOT_DEACTIVATABLE`);
  `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n` drops the same seventeen from its own declaration, which is what
  decides where the error envelope looks for a sentence (D-129's remaining sweep, MR 3 of eight;
  D-121 tiers T1 and T2; `specs/090-module-owned-error-codes/d129-sweep.md`).

  For a consumer this changes which bundle answers for those codes. No wire shape moves —
  `error.code` is unchanged — and no sentence is relocated: none of the seventeen had a
  translation in `en` or `pl` in any bundle. Writing one of those sentences is now a change to the
  owning module's own `i18n/{en,pl}.json` rather than to the platform's.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-shopping-lists` gains an `i18n` bundle it never had, declared as
  `i18n: { bundlesDir: 'i18n' }` and shipped in `files`. It holds the two `SHOPPING_LIST_*`
  sentences in both languages, which is an operator- and buyer-visible improvement: a Polish
  reader refused a delete of the default or the last shopping list now reads Polish prose instead
  of the English the raise site carries.

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.
