### Patch Changes

- 32fdf20: The `LICENSE` file in each package now names the copyright holder as Endora sp. z o.o.

  The MIT licence text is unchanged; only its copyright line moves from `Copyright (c) 2026 Endora`
  to `Copyright (c) 2026 Endora sp. z o.o.`, the registered legal entity. Nothing a package exports,
  declares or depends on changes. `@endora-commerce/contracts` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-invoice-ledger` also carry a one-sentence rewording in an already-published
  `CHANGELOG.md` entry, with no change to what that entry says about the code.

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 8f61a6b: Every published package now ships its own `LICENSE` and `README.md`.

  npm force-includes a file named `LICENSE` into the tarball exactly as it does `README.md`,
  whatever `files` says, so the text has to be in the package directory and not only at the
  repository root — `LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md` states that rule and, until this release, no package
  obeyed it. Measured on `master`: **0** of the 82 publishable packages carried a `LICENSE` and
  **14** carried a `README.md`, so every tarball shipped without licence text and 68 registry
  pages would have rendered empty.

  Both files are **generated**, by `pnpm --filter backend run manifests:generate`, and refused
  when stale by `manifests:check` in the `quality` job:
  - the `LICENSE` is the repository's root `LICENSE`, copied verbatim — the same single source
    the `license: MIT` field is already rendered from. A package that declares a licence of its
    own in the `SEE LICENSE IN <file>` form is skipped and keeps the file it names.
  - the `README.md` is rendered from what the package's own manifest declares: its description,
    its module id where it has one, every published subpath with what that layer holds, its peer
    dependencies with the optional ones marked, the locales its `i18n/` carries and what the
    tarball ships. A `README.md` **without** the generated marker on its first line is a human's
    and is never rewritten — the fourteen that existed are untouched.

  Five module packages also get their npm description back. `@endora-commerce/mod-blog`,
  `mod-credit-limits`, `mod-dhl-parcel`, `mod-google-analytics` and `mod-quote-requests` carried
  the note written when they were moved out of `backend/src/modules` — _"the first module to
  leave backend/src/modules … the manifest id stays identity of record"_ — as the sentence a
  registry shows under the package name. Each now carries the sentence its own module manifest
  declares, which is where `descriptionFor` seeds one from in the first place.

  No API changes, no new dependency, no behaviour change: what moves is what the tarball carries
  and what a package page says.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 0eeb9b5: Require Node >= 22.18.0.

  The previous floor was 22.17.0, which MikroORM 7 sets. 22.18.0 is the first release that
  strips TypeScript types without a flag, and that is what loads a deployment's overlay module:
  in a scaffolded instance `apps/` is outside every compiled member, so the unit the platform
  `import()`s is the client's own `.ts`. On 22.17.x that import throws
  `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` and the process dies before it listens. Emitting a `.js` beside
  the client's source was measured and refused — the overlay loader resolves `.js` before `.ts`
  while the divergence derivation admits both, so the sibling doubles every seam site in the
  report.

  Derived by probing 22.17.0, 22.17.1, 22.18.0 and 22.19.0 against a `.ts` module imported with
  no flag; 22.18.0 is the lowest that loads it.

  If you run 22.17.x, upgrade to 22.18 or later. Nothing else in these packages changed.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- e27bf6c: Every package that ships scannable UI now publishes its own Tailwind `@source`
  declarations at a new `./tailwind.css` subpath.

  A host compiling this package's utility classes no longer has to know where the
  package's sources are. Import the subpath from the stylesheet that builds your
  admin, and the package names its own layers:

  ```css
  @import 'tailwindcss';
  @import '@endora-commerce/mod-blog/tailwind.css';
  ```

  `@source` resolves relative to the stylesheet that declares it, so the paths hold
  wherever the package is installed. The file is generated from the package's layer
  inventory, ships in the tarball beside `package.json`, and its `dist` line is the one
  that matters to you — the `src` line beside it is inert in a published package and
  exists so that a checkout of this repository keeps scanning source in `dev`.

  **Nothing is removed or renamed**: every existing subpath resolves exactly as before.
  What is new is the obligation on the _host_ side, and it is a build error rather than a
  silent one. Before this, a host reached these packages with a glob over the monorepo
  (`@source "../../packages/**"`), which named a directory no installed tree has —
  and Tailwind reports nothing at all about a source that matches nothing, so such a host
  built green and rendered every screen unstyled. A host that now names a package that is
  not installed gets `Can't resolve`, and one whose tarball omits the file gets
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.

  `@endora-commerce/cms-components` deliberately does **not** publish this subpath. It
  ships a finished, prefixed stylesheet at `./styles.css` and must not also be scanned by
  its host.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- fa8f183: New package: the Google Analytics module, the third to leave `backend/src/modules/`
  (feature 080, T040b).

  Three subpaths, no root wildcard, every one of them compiled output (D-164):
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-google-analytics` — the manifest. Isomorphic,
    `@endora-commerce/contracts` its only import, and where the generated manifest index reads
    the module's identity, its eight settings, its two palette actions and its activation
    control (`google_analytics.module_enabled`) from.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-google-analytics/backend` — `registerModule(ctx)` and the `entities`
    array the host's ORM registry spreads. **`GaCustomEvent` is not exported by name** (D-168):
    the barrel imports it to build that array and nothing else, so
    `import type { GaCustomEvent } from '@endora-commerce/mod-google-analytics/backend'` does
    not compile in a consumer's tree, whoever the consumer is. Nothing is lost by that — the
    table's one cross-module edge is a foreign key into `sales_channels`, and a foreign key
    needs the table, never the owner's class (D-169).
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-google-analytics/migrations` — the `migrations` array the platform's
    package loader reads, plus `Migration20260715T171116GoogleAnalyticsInit` by name for the
    host's migration registry. One class, which is the case most likely to tempt an author into
    publishing the class alone: a missing `migrations` array makes the loader refuse the package
    outright at boot.

  `@endora-commerce/platform` is a `peerDependency` (D-160.2), and so are
  `@endora-commerce/contracts`, `@mikro-orm/*`, `fastify` and `zod`. This is the first module
  package to take **`bullmq`** as a peer, and it takes `ioredis` with it: the module builds its
  own `Queue` and `Worker` for server-side GA4 delivery and receives the connection from the
  host under `moduleQueueRedis`.

  The manifest id stays `google_analytics` — identity of record for the lifecycle registry, the
  settings store, the `google_analytics:read` / `google_analytics:write` permission codes, the
  i18n bundle paths and the ownership of its migration (D-142). The npm name is only how npm
  keeps names unique.

  **What this package proves that the first two could not.** It is the first with a real BullMQ
  consumer: `blog` has none and `quote_requests`' `RfqExpiryWorker` is a plain `sweep()`, which
  is why neither needed `bullmq`. `ctx.worker` is `defineModuleWorker`, and a packaged module
  that registered its worker outside that seam would leave the platform's stop switch attached
  to nothing while every existing test stayed green.
  `backend/test/integration/google_analytics/packaged-worker.test.ts` composes the package with
  a real Redis and measures both halves: a job the packaged producer enqueues is consumed, and
  `pauseWorkersFor('google_analytics')` reaches that worker and stops it.

- a92d972: `google_analytics` ships its admin surface, on a new `./admin` subpath.

  The package now exports `contributions` from `@endora-commerce/mod-google-analytics/admin`
  — three routes (`/google-analytics`, `/google-analytics/new`, `/google-analytics/:id`) and
  one sidebar entry — as an `AdminContributions` object. Every component is a dynamic-import
  factory, so a consumer's bundler splits the screens without being asked; the two editor
  routes share one factory, so they are one chunk and not two.

  Two things a consumer has to know:
  - **The sidebar label moved namespace.** It was `appShell.nav.googleAnalytics` in
    `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`'s shared `core` bundle and is now
    `nav.googleAnalytics.label` in this package's own `i18n/`, resolved in the
    `google_analytics` scope. Anything reading the old key gets a raw key back.
  - **The package peers on `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`, `react` and
    `react-router-dom`.** They are peers rather than dependencies for the reason
    `page-builder-core` is: the application must resolve exactly one copy, and a provider in
    one copy against a consumer in the other is a `null` context at runtime rather than a type
    error.

### Patch Changes

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.
