# @endora-commerce/mod-newsletter

## 0.109.0

### Minor Changes

- 0e33ca9: A newsletter signup block that subscribes through the platform's own newsletter module.

  - `newsletter.Signup` is declared by `@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter` (category _Forms_, English and Polish labels, 14 translatable texts) and rendered by `@endora-commerce/cms-components` (exported as `Signup`, with `NEWSLETTER_SUBSCRIBE_PATH` and `NEWSLETTER_SIGNUP_MAX_TOPICS`). It has a heading, text, e-mail label and placeholder, button label, up to 12 topics mapped to newsletter tag codes (optionally required), a consent text, a layout and translatable outcome messages. The form posts to the storefront path `/newsletter/subscribe`, works without JavaScript (the outcome is read back from the page URL, and the visitor lands back on the anchor of the `cms.Section` the block stands in) and, with JavaScript, submits in place and keeps the typed address. Subscriptions are recorded with `source: 'cms-block'`, the consent time and the chosen tags. The block disappears from the editor and the storefront when the newsletter module is off.
  - **A storefront must provide the `/newsletter/subscribe` route handler** for the block to work; the reference storefront ships one. To show the outcome without JavaScript, pass `location` (`{ path, query }`) to `CmsRenderProvider`; blocks read it with the new `useCmsRenderLocation()`.
  - `cms.NewsletterSignup` is kept unchanged for forms that post to an external newsletter service, and is relabelled **"External newsletter form"** in the block list. It adds an optional consent checkbox (`showConsent`, off by default, with an inline rich-text `consentLabel`); stored forms render as before.

- 61fc321: The storefront language is part of the URL path (`/pl/p/wiertarka`, `/en/p/drill`, issue #396).

  **Upgrade note for operators: existing sales channels keep their addresses.** The migration
  `Migration20261029T152922CoreSalesChannelsPrefixDefaultLanguage` adds the per-channel setting
  _Prefix the default language in URLs_ and switches it **off** on every channel that exists when it
  runs, so default-language URLs stay unprefixed; channels created later start **on**. To adopt
  prefixes for the default language too, switch _Prefix the default language in URLs_ on in
  _Sales channels_ → the channel. Other languages are prefixed either way: a former
  `/p/<key>?lang=<L>` link answers a permanent redirect to `/<prefix>/p/<key>`. A CMS page whose slug
  starts with a channel language prefix can no longer be saved.

  `@endora-commerce/contracts`:

  - New: `channelUrlLanguages`, `channelUrlLanguageAliases`, `storefrontPagePath`,
    `storefrontPagePathFor`, `storefrontDefaultPath`, `channelUrlLanguageSchema`,
    `channelUrlLanguageAliasSchema`, `URL_LANGUAGE_PREFIX_PATTERN`, types `ChannelUrlFacts`,
    `ChannelUrlLanguage`, `ChannelUrlLanguageAlias`; `productDefaultPath(key)`.
  - **`productPath` takes the channel's URL facts and never appends `?lang=`:**
    `productPath({ key, languageCode, channelDefaultLanguage })` (`/p/drill?lang=en-US`) becomes
    `productPath({ key, languageCode, channel })` (`/en/p/drill`), where `channel` is any
    `{ languages, defaultLanguage, prefixDefaultLanguage }` — the cached channel satisfies it.
  - `productKeyResolutionSchema`'s `redirect` requires `permanent` (`false` for a key of another
    channel language, answered 307); `productPagePathsSchema` requires `xDefault`.
  - Sales channel shapes carry `prefixDefaultLanguage` (create defaults to `true`); the public
    channel read answers `prefixDefaultLanguage`, `urlLanguages` and `urlLanguageAliases`.
  - `cmsPageUrl` (163 R24) takes the channel's URL facts and composes the prefixed path:
    `cmsPageUrl({ path, languageCode, channelDefaultLanguage })` (`/about-us?lang=en-US`) becomes
    `cmsPageUrl({ path, languageCode, channel })` (`/en/about-us`). The resolved CMS page's `url` and
    `alternates`, and the storefront page index, therefore carry each language's own slug under its
    prefix.
  - `CmsPageRecord` gains optional `languages` and `translations` (the `seo` sitemap lists each
    language at its own slug); `cmsPageSummarySchema` gains an optional
    `shadowedByLanguagePrefix` (any of the page's slugs, per-language ones included).

  Emitters (catalog, seo sitemap, product feeds, organizations, customers, newsletter, comparisons,
  mfa, invoices) compose prefixed storefront URLs; the product feed `link` uses the product's key in
  the feed language; the invoice e-mail links the storefront order page; the admin password reset
  links `/password-reset/confirm`. `cms-components` localizes block links through the render
  context's `localizePath`.

- ecdd2f7: `newsletter.Signup` picks its topics from the newsletter's tags and can collect subscriber attributes.

  - **Topics:** in the admin, a topic's tag is chosen by name from the newsletter's tags (`GET /api/v1/admin/newsletter/tags`); the block still stores the tag code. A stored code the list does not hold stays selected, and without the list (no `newsletter:read`, the module off) the code is typed as before.
  - **Subscriber attributes (new, optional `attributes`):** up to 10 of the newsletter's custom fields, rendered after the e-mail field and before the topics — a yes/no field as a checkbox, a text, number or date field as the matching input (text at most 500 characters). Each item stores `key`, `type` and `fieldLabel` (picked together in the admin from `GET /api/v1/admin/newsletter/custom-fields`; typed as a key and a type select elsewhere), plus an optional `label`, `placeholder` (not for a yes/no field) and `required`. The form posts `attr.<key>` and one hidden `attrSpec` per attribute; a required attribute left empty is refused in the browser and by the storefront handler with the new `fields` reason, whose message is the block's `messages.fields`, else the page language's text (`CmsRenderProvider`'s new optional `newsletterSignupText`), else English. With no attributes the block's markup is unchanged.
  - `@endora-commerce/page-builder-admin` exports `createNewsletterTagCodeField`, `createNewsletterCustomFieldField`, their controls and `withNewsletterAttributePick`; `mod-cms` swaps them into the block in its editor.
  - `mod-newsletter` declares `attributes[].label`, `attributes[].placeholder` and `messages.fields` as translatable, and ships the new field labels in English and Polish.

### Patch Changes

- 0e33ca9: The dark scheme's decorative backdrop can be given as a URL, `cms.Tabs` can keep its tab bar in one scrolling line, and a `cms.Column` can distribute its blocks vertically and reorder them per breakpoint.

  Nothing changes for a page that does not use them: the default markup and look are the ones the blocks had.

  - **Backdrop by URL.** The brand tokens' schemes gain an optional `decorativeUrl`, validated by the new `brandMediaUrlSchema` and `BRAND_MEDIA_URL_RE` in `@endora-commerce/contracts`. It accepts an `https:` URL, or a path starting with `/`, of up to 2048 characters, with no quotes, parentheses, backslashes, angle brackets or whitespace. The library asset (`decorativeAssetId`) wins when both are set. `brandTokensToCss` takes a new `mediaUrl` option, which rebases a `/path` (the storefront and the admin pass their API origin). It checks the stored value again and writes it as an escaped CSS string. The brand screen has a **Decorative backdrop URL** field under the dark scheme's asset picker. `@endora-commerce/page-builder-core/brand-tokens` re-exports `BRAND_MEDIA_URL_RE`.
  - **Scrolling tab bar.** `cms.Tabs` gains `barOverflow: 'wrap' | 'scroll'`. Unset, it wraps as before. `scroll` adds `cmsc-pb-tabs--scroll` and keeps the bar in one line that scrolls sideways inside the block, with scroll snapping and no page overflow. The roles and the keyboard model are unchanged. A tab chosen with the pointer is scrolled into the bar's view. The tab focus ring (`.cmsc-pb-tabs__tab:focus-visible`), lost in an earlier stylesheet edit, is restored.
  - **Column distribution.** `cms.Column` gains `distribute`: `'start'` (the default), `'center'`, `'end'`, `'space-between'` or `'last-to-bottom'`. It is written as `data-pb-distribute`. The column's published block slot now carries the class `cmsc-pb-column-stack`.
  - **Block order per breakpoint.** `withHideOn` offers `stackOrder`: `'auto'`, `'first'`, `'1'`–`'6'` or `'last'`, one value per breakpoint, on the Responsive tab. The field appears only when the block's parent is in the new `BLOCK_ORDER_PARENTS` export (`['cms.Column']`), through a `resolveFields` it now adds to every wrapped block, so no block's static fields change. The value is written on the wrapper as `data-pb-order` and `--pb-order(-md|-lg)`, and the stylesheet reads it as the CSS `order`. Only the visual order changes: the DOM and focus order stay the stored order. `STACK_ORDER_VALUES` and the `StackOrder` type are exported.

  The `cms`, `catalog`, `blog` and `newsletter` bundles carry the English and Polish labels.

- 0e33ca9: The page builder's settings panel speaks one language: one switch for every on/off setting, and every label translated — the settings every block shares translated once.

  Nothing stored changes: a switch stores the same `true` / `false` the Yes/No choices stored.

  - `@endora-commerce/page-builder-core` exports `createToggleField({ label, defaultValue?, metadata? })` — a `role="switch"` button inside its label, operable by pointer and keyboard, showing the block's default while the prop is unset; with the responsive metadata it edits the breakpoint the Responsive tab selects — and `ToggleSwitch` for a custom control's own on/off setting. Every Yes/No radio of the bundled blocks, the row's "Clip content", a video's autoplay, muted, loop and controls, a carousel's loop, autoplay and equal heights, its arrows and dots (now **Show arrows** / **Show dots**), the border's **Show border**, the section reveal's desktop-only, a media-and-text video's autoplay and a link's **Open in new tab** are switches.
  - Shared fields carry their key: `withSharedFieldLabel(key, field)`, `sharedFieldLabel(field)` and `PAGE_BUILDER_SHARED_FIELD_KEYS` (editor name, Hide on, order in the column, box spacing, border, background, rounded corners, shadow, colour, typography, minimum height). The admin translates such a field from the `core` bundle's `pageBuilder.sharedFields.<key>` after the block's own key and before the English; a block that relabels a shared field keeps its own key. `applyPageBuilderTranslations` takes the shared resolver as a fifth argument, and translates the options a custom field carries.
  - The words inside the page builder's controls — spacing, border (a border side now labels its **Width (px)**, **Style** and **Color**), the per-breakpoint hints, the editor's name, the background control and the asset picker — come from the `core` bundle in English and Polish.
  - `withHideOn` puts **Hide on** back when a block's own `resolveFields` returns a field set without it (the heading, row, table and map had lost it).
  - Every bundled block's field and option labels resolve in Polish; the block keys are in the declaring module's bundle (`cms`, `catalog`, `blog`, `newsletter`), the shared ones in `core`. Labels use US spelling (**Color scheme**, **Center**), one wording (**Email**, **Alt text**, **Minimum height**, "Custom … (px)", **Rounded corners**), and side choices read **Left / Right**.

- 3ccf23b: The newsletter sign-up block gains layout options: the button inside the field, topic columns and a visually hidden e-mail label.

  Unset, the form looks as before; the posted fields never change.

  - `buttonPlacement: 'inside'` puts the submit button inside the e-mail field's box, with `fieldShape` rounded (default) or `pill`.
  - `topicsColumns` (1–4) lays the topic checkboxes out as a grid of columns.
  - `hideEmailLabel` hides the e-mail label visually; it stays the field's label for screen readers.

- 3ccf23b: The product listings' header lead look.

  Nothing changes for content that does not use them: every new option is optional, and a block saved before renders the same markup.

  - **Product grid and product slider.** `leadSize` / `leadSizePx` (per breakpoint), `leadWeight` and `leadColor` for the header's lead, as the latest posts block's lead.
  - The editor fields carry English and Polish labels.

- 3ccf23b: Icon choices and a per-breakpoint feature layout: the feature list's icon position and item widths, a newsletter sign-up button icon, and the download tile's icon button glyph.

  Nothing changes for content that does not use them: every new option is optional, and a block saved before renders the same markup.

  - **Feature list.** `iconPosition` takes a value per breakpoint, so the icon can sit beside the title on one breakpoint and above it on another; one stored position keeps its meaning. An item's `span` (1–12) sets its width in columns of 12 on desktops. The other items keep their share of the columns.
  - **Newsletter sign-up.** `buttonIcon`, an icon from the catalog, shows after the button's label.
  - **Download tile.** `iconButtonIcon`, an icon from the catalog, replaces the round icon button's glyph. Left empty, the tile shows the download arrow, or the onward arrow for a link.
  - **Icon catalog.** Adds `cloudDownload`.
  - The editor fields carry English and Polish labels.

- ecdd2f7: A subscriber's custom-field value is stored only when it matches the field's type.

  - **Behaviour change:** the merge shared by the public `POST /api/v1/newsletter/subscribe`, the admin's subscriber create and the signed-in self subscribe used to keep any value whose key is a defined custom field, so a text could land in a number field. It now also checks the type — yes/no → a boolean, number → a finite number, date → an existing `YYYY-MM-DD` date, text → a string of at most 500 characters; `null` still clears a value — and drops a value that does not match. Nothing is refused: the request succeeds and the valid values are stored, as an unknown key was already dropped before.

- bd7968e: Every sidebar screen of these eight modules can now be found from the command palette (⌘K / CTRL+K), with English and Polish labels and search keywords. Each action carries the permission code of the screen it opens, so the palette never offers a screen the operator is refused.

  - `@endora-commerce/mod-catalog` declares `open-attribute-sets`, `open-attachment-types` and `open-bulk-operations` (`catalog:read`).
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-crm` declares `open-crm-tags` and `open-crm-workflow` (`crm:configure`).
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-inventory` declares `open-warehouses`, `open-low-stock` and `open-stock-notifications` (`inventory:read`), and `import-stock` (`inventory:write`).
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter` declares `open-newsletter-tags` and `open-newsletter-blocks` (`newsletter:read`), and `open-newsletter-provider` (`newsletter:write`).
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-orders` declares `new-order` for the order-entry form (`orders:write`).
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-projects` declares `open-project-roles` and `open-project-loss-reasons` (`projects:configure`).
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-promotions` declares `open-promotion-rules` (`promotions:read`).
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-settings` declares `open-setting-groups` (`settings:read`) and `clear-cache` (`settings:write`).

- d86466f: The command-palette actions of the content and marketing modules (`analytics`, `assets_library`, `blog`, `cms`, `google_analytics`, `google_tag_manager`, `linkedin_ads`, `megamenu`, `meta_ads`, `newsletter`, `pwa`, `seo`, `transactional_emails`) keep only English `keywords` in their manifests. Their Polish search words moved to each module's `i18n/pl.json` under the action's new `keywordsKey`, with an English entry in `i18n/en.json` (issue #573, following #560). A Polish operator finds the same screens by the same words; an English-language admin is no longer offered the Polish ones.

## 0.108.0

### Patch Changes

- 3a9dc6e: Raise `nodemailer` to `^10.1.4` (the lockfile resolves 10.2.1). This version tightens address parsing, strips credentials from a cross-origin redirect and caps the work one message can cause the mailer to do. The pool and content-stream behaviour changes in 10.1.0 do not apply here, because both modules build a plain, unpooled transport and send string bodies.

## 0.107.0

### Minor Changes

- dd9ab59: Campaign e-mails can carry open and click tracking, switched on by an operator. When it is on
  and a campaign is sent, each recipient's message gets an invisible 1×1 image and its absolute
  `http(s)` links are routed through the click redirect, each with a signed token bound to the recipient's send record, a link id
  (`link-1`, `link-2`, … in document order) and the link's destination. `mailto:`, `tel:`, in-page
  anchors, relative links and the module's own unsubscribe and confirmation links are left as they
  are; the plain-text part is sent unchanged. The per-campaign opened and clicked counts and the
  per-link clicks reflect what recipients do while tracking is on.

  The two public trackers take their token in the query string, because a signed token is longer
  than the router's 100-character path-parameter limit and the path form was answered `414`
  before reaching the handler:

  - `GET /api/v1/newsletter/o/:token.gif` is now `GET /api/v1/newsletter/open.gif?token=<token>`
  - `GET /api/v1/newsletter/c/:token?u=<url>` is now `GET /api/v1/newsletter/click?token=<token>&u=<url>`

  The click redirect still leads only to the destination its token binds, sends a mismatching
  destination to the storefront home page and answers an invalid or missing token `410`.

  Two new settings in the Newsletter group, `newsletter.tracking.opens_enabled` and
  `newsletter.tracking.clicks_enabled`, switch the two kinds of tracking independently. Both
  default to off, so an instance sends campaigns untracked until an operator switches them on; they
  can be set per sales channel, and are labelled in English and Polish on the
  Settings screen. A campaign with `trackingEnabled: false` is sent without either. Automation
  e-mails are not tracked. `NEWSLETTER_SETTING_CODES` in `@endora-commerce/contracts` gains
  `TRACKING_OPENS_ENABLED` and `TRACKING_CLICKS_ENABLED`.

### Patch Changes

- 248a9df: Routes a visitor reaches before signing in, or that arrive with no storefront channel, declare
  `salesChannelAccess: 'open'` and stay reachable when an operator closes a sales channel to
  anonymous visitors: administrator sign-in and sign-out, second-factor verification and set-up
  tickets and federated sign-in (both surfaces), `GET /api/v1/i18n/config`, the dictionary reads the
  registration form uses, the crawler policy, product-feed downloads by token, and the newsletter
  confirmation, unsubscribe and tracking links.
- ad55813: E-mail HTML previews are drawn in sandboxed frames that do not run scripts: the e-mail editor's full preview and the newsletter campaign preview carry `sandbox=""`, and the e-mail editor's inline preview of an embedded block or template is drawn in a script-less frame sized to its content instead of being injected into the editor's document. The inline frame's title is the new `core` key `pageBuilder.emailPreview.embedTitle` (English and Polish).
- 4f9daef: The newsletter click tracker (`GET /api/v1/newsletter/c/:token?u=<url>`) redirects only when its
  token verifies, and only to the `u` destination the token was minted for: a click token now binds
  its destination through a `urlHash` claim signed into it at send time. A token that does not
  verify answers `410`; a valid token that binds no destination, or whose binding does not match
  `u`, records the click and lands on the storefront home page.

## 0.105.0

### Patch Changes

- 0184be5: An e-mail that was only written to the server log is no longer reported as sent. On an instance
  with no `SMTP_URL` the console mailer logs the message and used to answer `{ status: 'sent' }`,
  and the transactional e-mail service answered a constant `sent` of its own, so every module that
  records or reports a delivery recorded one that did not happen.

  **Breaking for a consumer of the two port types — three unions gain a member:**

  - `EmailMailerSendOutcome` gains `{ status: 'logged' }`. The console mailer answers it instead of
    `sent`; the SMTP mailer and `InMemoryMailer` still answer `sent`.
  - `TransactionalSendOutcome` gains `{ status: 'logged' }`, and `TransactionalEmailSender.send`
    passes the transport's `logged` on. A transport's `suppressed` (an already accepted message id)
    is still answered as `sent`, as before.
  - `emailDeliveryStatusSchema` / `EmailDeliveryStatus` gain `'logged'`, and
    `invoiceEmailNotSentReasonSchema` / `InvoiceEmailNotSentReason` gain `'logged'`.

  What to do: code with an exhaustive `switch` over one of these unions, or that passes
  `outcome.status` into a closed union of its own, stops compiling until it handles `logged`; code
  that reads `outcome.reason` after `outcome.status !== 'sent'` must narrow to
  `outcome.status === 'suppressed'` first, because `logged` carries no reason. Code that compares
  with `=== 'sent'` keeps compiling and now treats a logged message as not sent. `logged` is not a
  failure and there is nothing to retry: the same call would log the message again. An own
  implementation of `EmailMailerPort` or `TransactionalEmailSender` needs no change.

  What changes on an instance without a mail server:

  - `email_deliveries` rows are written with `status = 'logged'` instead of `'sent'`. The column is
    a plain `varchar(16)`, so there is no migration; rows written earlier keep `sent`.
  - The order, return, payment-status, shipment and invoice e-mail results answer
    `{ sent: false, reason: 'logged' }`, each with its usual "was not sent" log line. Issuing an
    invoice or re-sending its e-mail from the Admin UI says the e-mail was not sent because no mail
    server is configured, in English and Polish (`invoices.emailNotSent.logged`).
  - A CRM Event reminder is recorded as delivered to the bell alone — or as undeliverable when the
    bell is unavailable too — instead of "bell and e-mail".
  - `POST /api/v1/organizations/register` answers `emailVerificationSent: false` when the
    verification e-mail went through the in-code builder and was only logged.

  No setting, permission or migration changes.

- de4b41d: Previewing or sending a newsletter campaign that has no sales channel no longer fails. The channel
  of such a campaign is read back from the database as `undefined` rather than `null`, and that value
  was handed unchanged to the branding source, whose settings read refuses anything that is neither a
  channel id nor `null` — so the preview answered `500`, and the send of the same campaign, and every
  send step of an automation with no sales channel, failed the same way. It showed only in a
  deployment that contributes e-mail branding, which the default one does.

  A campaign or automation with no sales channel is now previewed and sent with the **default** sales
  channel's logo and accent colour. One that has a sales channel is unaffected.

  No API, setting or permission changes.

### Minor Changes

- d0e76fd: Newsletter campaigns and automations render the e-mail blocks other modules contribute through `emailBlockRendererRegistry`, under the same rules as transactional e-mail: a switched-off module's block contributes nothing, and a renderer that throws is logged and does not stop the message. Adds the `pageBuilder.blockPreview.unavailable` string (English and Polish).

## 0.102.0

### Minor Changes

- 255b60b: The page builder's editor peer moves from `@measured/puck` to `@puckeditor/core`. Puck renamed
  its package at 0.21 (`npm install @measured/puck` now prints _"Puck has moved"_), and these
  packages now import `@puckeditor/core` 0.23 — the code, the types and the stylesheet
  (`@puckeditor/core/puck.css`).

  **What a consumer changes.** If your project declares the editor itself — an admin application
  that bundles `@endora-commerce/page-builder-admin`, `@endora-commerce/mod-cms` or any of the
  modules above, or a storefront rendering pages through `@endora-commerce/cms-components`:

  ```bash
  pnpm remove @measured/puck
  pnpm add @puckeditor/core@^0.23.0
  ```

  and rename the specifier in any import of your own (`'@measured/puck'` → `'@puckeditor/core'`,
  `'@measured/puck/puck.css'` → `'@puckeditor/core/puck.css'`). A project scaffolded with
  `create-endora-commerce` / `endora new instance` gets the new name at its root from this release
  on; an existing instance renames the one line in its root `package.json`. Leaving
  `@measured/puck` installed does not satisfy the peer — the two names are different packages —
  so a bundler resolves `@puckeditor/core` to nothing and the editor fails to build.

  **Stored content is unchanged.** Puck 0.21–0.23 changed no part of the page data shape: CMS
  pages, blocks, templates, blog bodies, e-mail templates, newsletter blocks and invoice templates
  persisted under 0.20 render and edit as they did, with no migration and no read-time adapter.

  **The editor looks and behaves as it did.** Three 0.21–0.23 defaults that reshape the editor are
  pinned back for every builder host through new exports of `@endora-commerce/page-builder-core/editor`:
  `withPuckLegacySideBar(plugins)` keeps the stacked Components + Outline side bar instead of the
  0.21 Plugin Rail, `PUCK_LEGACY_VIEWPORTS` keeps the 0.20 Small / Medium / Large viewports without
  the 0.21 full-width one (the CMS host keeps passing its own breakpoints), and `PUCK_LEGACY_DND`
  keeps the 0.20 fluid drag-and-drop instead of the 0.23 insertion line. A host of your own built on
  these packages can pass the same three to its `<Puck>`.

  `@puckeditor/core` 0.23 requires Node 20 or later, below this platform's own floor (22.17).

### Patch Changes

- 489a0b6: Documentation: migrations are now named by the file that actually ships. The pages cited
  migrations by a retired numbering (`024_settings_init.ts`, "migration 102", `080_returns_init.ts`
  and others), which matches no file in any package. Each reference now gives the real
  timestamped filename, such as `20260611T140346_catalog_product_value_overrides_init.ts`, and
  says which module owns it where that is a different module. The organizations page also no
  longer claims that the `suspended` → `blocked` migration writes an audit-log entry: it writes
  an explanatory `blocked_reason` on each remapped row.

## 0.101.1

### Patch Changes

- 69a3717: The `fastify` peer is now `^5.11.0` instead of `^5`, so an install can no longer resolve Fastify 5.0–5.10. On those versions an async route handler that calls `reply.send()` without `return` throws `ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT` as an uncaught exception from Fastify's onSend hook runner, and the process crash-loops; Fastify 5.11.0 catches that error and the server keeps running. An instance scaffolded by `endora new instance` now declares `fastify@^5.11.0` as well. Nothing to do on upgrade unless your project pins Fastify below 5.11 — move it to `^5.11.0` (the repository itself runs 5.12.5).

  declares or depends on changes. `@endora-commerce/contracts` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-invoice-ledger` also carry a one-sentence rewording in an already-published
  `CHANGELOG.md` entry, with no change to what that entry says about the code.

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- 8f61a6b: Every published package now ships its own `LICENSE` and `README.md`.

  npm force-includes a file named `LICENSE` into the tarball exactly as it does `README.md`,
  whatever `files` says, so the text has to be in the package directory and not only at the
  repository root — `LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md` states that rule and, until this release, no package
  obeyed it. Measured on `master`: **0** of the 82 publishable packages carried a `LICENSE` and
  **14** carried a `README.md`, so every tarball shipped without licence text and 68 registry
  pages would have rendered empty.

  Both files are **generated**, by `pnpm --filter backend run manifests:generate`, and refused
  when stale by `manifests:check` in the `quality` job:
  - the `LICENSE` is the repository's root `LICENSE`, copied verbatim — the same single source
    the `license: MIT` field is already rendered from. A package that declares a licence of its
    own in the `SEE LICENSE IN <file>` form is skipped and keeps the file it names.
  - the `README.md` is rendered from what the package's own manifest declares: its description,
    its module id where it has one, every published subpath with what that layer holds, its peer
    dependencies with the optional ones marked, the locales its `i18n/` carries and what the
    tarball ships. A `README.md` **without** the generated marker on its first line is a human's
    and is never rewritten — the fourteen that existed are untouched.

  Five module packages also get their npm description back. `@endora-commerce/mod-blog`,
  `mod-credit-limits`, `mod-dhl-parcel`, `mod-google-analytics` and `mod-quote-requests` carried
  the note written when they were moved out of `backend/src/modules` — _"the first module to
  leave backend/src/modules … the manifest id stays identity of record"_ — as the sentence a
  registry shows under the package name. Each now carries the sentence its own module manifest
  declares, which is where `descriptionFor` seeds one from in the first place.

  No API changes, no new dependency, no behaviour change: what moves is what the tarball carries
  and what a package page says.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 0eeb9b5: Require Node >= 22.18.0.

  The previous floor was 22.17.0, which MikroORM 7 sets. 22.18.0 is the first release that
  strips TypeScript types without a flag, and that is what loads a deployment's overlay module:
  in a scaffolded instance `apps/` is outside every compiled member, so the unit the platform
  `import()`s is the client's own `.ts`. On 22.17.x that import throws
  `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` and the process dies before it listens. Emitting a `.js` beside
  the client's source was measured and refused — the overlay loader resolves `.js` before `.ts`
  while the divergence derivation admits both, so the sibling doubles every seam site in the
  report.

  Derived by probing 22.17.0, 22.17.1, 22.18.0 and 22.19.0 against a `.ts` module imported with
  no flag; 22.18.0 is the lowest that loads it.

  If you run 22.17.x, upgrade to 22.18 or later. Nothing else in these packages changed.

### Minor Changes

- 6c8d958: Eight migration statements move to the module whose dependency closure guarantees the table they
  name (D-226, `specs/120-migration-closure-bridge-ownership/` Phase 3).

  A migration may name a table only if its own module creates it, a module in its transitive manifest
  `dependencies` closure creates it, or the platform creates it. Where that did not hold, an instance
  that omitted the creating module could not migrate a fresh database at all — the failure this rule
  was ruled from was `relation "cms_pages" does not exist`.

  **No class is renamed and no stamp moves.** `mikro_orm_migrations` persists the migration class name
  and holds no checksum (measured on `@mikro-orm/migrations@6.6.13`), so a database that has applied
  one of the reduced bodies is offered nothing from it. What an upgrading consumer receives is the
  five new migrations below, each written idempotently, each a no-op against a database that already
  has the object and the real change against a fresh one. Measured on a database migrated at the
  previous revision: exactly five pending, every table's `pg_class` OID unchanged after applying
  them, and the resulting schema byte-identical to the previous revision's fresh schema.

  **`@endora-commerce/platform`** — two frozen bodies lose statements they could never have been
  ordered for, the platform declaring no dependencies and so never being orderable after a module's
  table. `Migration20260430T170044CoreSalesChannelsPromote` no longer adds `quote_requests.sales_channel_id`,
  its foreign key or its index. `Migration20260717T134752CoreTenantScopeIndexes` is now **empty** —
  all three of its indexes were on module-owned tables — and the class stays, because its name is on
  `BASELINE_MIGRATIONS` and removing it would move seventy frozen positions.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-quote-requests`** — new `Migration20260912T125614QuoteRequestsQuoteRequestChannelAttribution`:
  the `sales_channel_id` column, its `ON DELETE RESTRICT` foreign key and its index, `add column if not exists`
  with the constraint add guarded by a `pg_constraint` probe. The column is still NULLABLE.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-analytics`** — new `Migration20260912T125655AnalyticsEventsTenantScopeIndexes`:
  the two tenant-key indexes on `analytics_events`, verbatim and `if not exists`.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter`** — new `Migration20260912T125702NewsletterSubscriberTenantScopeIndex`:
  the tenant-key index on `newsletter_subscribers.customer_account_id`, verbatim and `if not exists`.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-cms`** — new `Migration20260912T125709CmsPageBodyAssetRefIndex`: the GIN
  index on `cms_pages.body`. It exists for `assets_library`' reference-protection scan and now lives
  with the table it is on; `cms` declares `assets_library` and not the other way round, so this is the
  only direction in which the closure holds.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-assets-library`** — `Migration20260505T102206AssetsLibraryInit` no longer
  creates that index. An instance installing this package without `cms` no longer carries a migration
  that indexes a table nothing builds.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-inventory`** — new `Migration20260912T125716InventoryOrganizationWarehouses`:
  the `organization_warehouses` bridge, `create table if not exists`, verbatim columns, primary key and
  both foreign keys. This is D-226's bridge rule one namespace over — an always-present near side
  (`organizations`) and a switchable far side — and it has a visible consequence:
  `module:uninstall --hard inventory` now reverts this table, a hard uninstall reverting by registry
  module id.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-organizations`** — `Migration20260611T140349OrganizationsConsolidation` no
  longer creates `organization_warehouses`. Its `warehouses` foreign key named a table this module
  neither owns nor declares, and could not declare: `inventory` already declares `organizations`.

- 8e86e55: Eleven container names a module read and nothing defaulted are now defaulted by
  the module that reads them, so a composition that contributes nothing can
  resolve every one of them.

  `@endora-commerce/platform` — `composeApp` registers two more names:
  `customerOrganizationIdResolver`, the tenth actor-shaped name, whose value
  expression reads `request.actor` and nothing else; and `newsletterTokenSecret`,
  the resolved `NEWSLETTER_TOKEN_SECRET`.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter` — `newsletterModule`'s `defaultChannelId`
  option becomes `resolveDefaultChannelId: () => Promise<string | null>`. A
  consumer composing the module through `registerModule` is unaffected; a consumer
  calling `newsletterModule` directly passes `async () => null` where it passed
  `null`. The `NewsletterBridge` interface is removed — the module reads its nine
  members itself.

  `mod-catalog`, `mod-customers`, `mod-ksef`, `mod-orders`, `mod-quote-requests` —
  each registers the names it reads. No published shape changes; a composition
  that contributes one of them still overrides the default, which is what the
  contribution window is for.

  `mod-catalog`, `mod-customers` and `mod-orders` declare new manifest edges for
  ports they now resolve themselves: `catalog` -> `search:searchReindexPort`,
  `customers` -> `admin_roles`, `orders` -> `admin_users` and `admin_roles`. Every
  one of those owners declares `activation.nonDeactivatable`, so no operator loses
  an activation control.

### Minor Changes

- e27bf6c: Every package that ships scannable UI now publishes its own Tailwind `@source`
  declarations at a new `./tailwind.css` subpath.

  A host compiling this package's utility classes no longer has to know where the
  package's sources are. Import the subpath from the stylesheet that builds your
  admin, and the package names its own layers:

  ```css
  @import 'tailwindcss';
  @import '@endora-commerce/mod-blog/tailwind.css';
  ```

  `@source` resolves relative to the stylesheet that declares it, so the paths hold
  wherever the package is installed. The file is generated from the package's layer
  inventory, ships in the tarball beside `package.json`, and its `dist` line is the one
  that matters to you — the `src` line beside it is inert in a published package and
  exists so that a checkout of this repository keeps scanning source in `dev`.

  **Nothing is removed or renamed**: every existing subpath resolves exactly as before.
  What is new is the obligation on the _host_ side, and it is a build error rather than a
  silent one. Before this, a host reached these packages with a glob over the monorepo
  (`@source "../../packages/**"`), which named a directory no installed tree has —
  and Tailwind reports nothing at all about a source that matches nothing, so such a host
  built green and rendered every screen unstyled. A host that now names a package that is
  not installed gets `Can't resolve`, and one whose tarball omits the file gets
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.

  `@endora-commerce/cms-components` deliberately does **not** publish this subpath. It
  ships a finished, prefixed stylesheet at `./styles.css` and must not also be scanned by
  its host.

### Minor Changes

- 3eef7a2: `newsletter` and `transactional_emails` ship their admin surfaces.

  **New `./admin` subpath on two packages.** `@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-transactional-emails` each export `contributions` — an
  `AdminContributions` object — from `@endora-commerce/mod-<id>/admin`, and nothing else.
  Seventeen routes and nine sidebar entries between them, all at the paths and codes the
  hand-written host registrations carried:
  - `mod-newsletter` — `/newsletter/subscribers` (the landing route), `/newsletter/campaigns`,
    `/newsletter/campaigns/:id`, `/newsletter/campaigns/:id/stats`, `/newsletter/automations`,
    `/newsletter/automations/:id`, `/newsletter/tags` and `/newsletter/blocks` on
    `newsletter:read`; `/newsletter/campaigns/new`, `/newsletter/automations/new` and
    `/newsletter/provider` on `newsletter:write`, which is the code the API enforces on the
    `POST`s those three screens exist to make and the code the provider row already carried.
    Six sidebar rows, in the `newsletter` section at weights 100 through 600.
  - `mod-transactional-emails` — `/transactional-emails` (the landing route),
    `/transactional-emails/blocks`, `/transactional-emails/blocks/:id`,
    `/transactional-emails/templates`, `/transactional-emails/templates/:id` and
    `/transactional-emails/:code`, all on `transactional_emails:read`. Three sidebar rows, in
    the `messaging` section at weights 100, 200 and 300.

  Route components are dynamic-import factories, so a consumer's bundler emits one chunk per
  screen, and every screen resolves its design system through `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`.

  **Both packages declare `@endora-commerce/page-builder-admin` as a peer dependency**, and
  that is what makes the two a batch rather than two rows. Their whole recorded admin debt was
  six reaches into `admin/src/modules/_shared/email-builder/`; P5b published that directory as
  `@endora-commerce/page-builder-admin/email`, so the six became bare specifiers into an
  `exports` map and there was nothing left to repair. Three `newsletter` screens (the campaign
  editor, the automation builder and the block editor) and three `transactional_emails` ones
  (both fragment editors and the e-mail editor, through this module's own `EmailEditorPane`
  adapter) mount `EmailEditorPane` and `EmailVariablesProvider` from it. `manifests:generate`
  derives the peer from those specifiers; a consumer installing either package from a registry
  must be able to resolve it.

  **Two new components on `mod-transactional-emails`, both internal to its `./admin` layer.**
  `EmailBlockEditorPage` and `EmailTemplateEditorPage` each render `EmailFragmentEditor` with
  one `kind`. The admin host used to pass that as a prop from its route table
  (`element={<EmailFragmentEditor kind="block" />}`), and an `AdminRouteDeclaration.component`
  is a factory returning a module whose `default` is read — there is nowhere in a declaration
  to put an argument.

  **Three new palette actions**, replacing hand-written rows in the admin shell, with the same
  destinations, codes and keywords:
  - `mod-newsletter` — `open-newsletter-campaigns` → `/newsletter/campaigns` and
    `open-newsletter-automations` → `/newsletter/automations`, both `newsletter:read`.
  - `mod-transactional-emails` — `open-email-blocks` → `/transactional-emails/blocks`,
    `transactional_emails:read`.

  Both packages' `i18n/{en,pl}.json` gain the nav labels (`nav.subscribers.label` and its five
  siblings; `nav.transactionalEmails.label`, `nav.emailBlocks.label`,
  `nav.emailTemplates.label`) and the new actions' label and description keys, module-relative
  and in both shipped languages.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-i18n` loses fifteen keys**: `appShell.nav.newsletter*` (six),
  `appShell.nav.transactionalEmails`, `appShell.nav.emailBlocks`, `appShell.nav.emailTemplates`
  and the six `appShell.palette.sub.*` keys the deleted palette rows named. Nothing renders
  them after this change — the labels are the two modules' own now. `appShell.section.messaging`
  and `appShell.section.newsletter` stay: the shell still owns the section taxonomy.

- f66359f: The stored Page Builder block names are namespaced, once, by five migrations.

  Each of the five table-owning modules rewrites **its own** columns — `cms` three, `blog`
  two, `transactional_emails` three, `newsletter` two, `invoices` one — with a recursive
  `pg_temp` function generated from `FROZEN_BLOCK_RENAMES`. A migration belongs to the module
  that owns the **table**, never to the module that owns the new name, so no new manifest
  `dependencies` edge arises: a block name is a string value inside a JSONB document, not a
  foreign key.

  The rewrite is **structural**: it replaces the value of a `type` property in a node position
  and nothing else. Twelve of the 74 names are ordinary English words (`Row`, `Text`, `Image`,
  `Map`, `Button`, …) that occur throughout shop content, so a textual substitution would
  corrupt a `RawHtml` block's markup and every `alt` attribute in the shop.

  It is **idempotent by construction** — every key of the map is bare and every value is
  dotted, so a second run finds nothing — and it **cannot fail on its input**: a name the map
  does not hold is left byte-identical and reported, never quarantined. `down()` applies the
  inverse over the identical walk.

  `cms` gains an operator command for the pre-flight:

  ```
  pnpm --filter backend run cli -- cms block-names
  ```

  Read-only, across all eleven columns, classifying every stored name as _will be renamed →
  new name_, _already namespaced_ or _unrecognised_. Run it before upgrading, resolve or accept
  the unrecognised set, take a backup, upgrade, and run it again: every _will be renamed_
  becomes _already namespaced_ and the unrecognised set is unchanged.

  `catalog`, `orders` and `ksef` are patch-bumped because their block declarations are now what
  the registry serves — the eight `catalog` blocks, the eight `orders` ones and
  `ksef.InvoiceSection` were previously registered as `cms`' and `invoices`'.

- 661e80d: Fourteen new packages: the **second** batch of modules to leave `backend/src/modules/`
  (feature 080, T040b). Five moved one at a time, then ten together; these fourteen are the
  same shape as the ten, and the properties below hold fourteen times over.

  **One changeset, not fourteen**, for the reason batch one gives: a changeset is written for
  the consumer of a package, and a package that did not exist a moment ago has no upgrader to
  instruct. What genuinely differs per package is its layer inventory, and that is the table.

  Every subpath is compiled output (D-164); none has a root wildcard; each package's `.` is
  its `manifest.ts`, where the generated manifest index reads the module's identity, its
  `dependencies`, its permission codes, its command-palette actions, its settings and its
  activation control.

  **`./backend` publishes `registerModule(ctx)` and an `entities` array, and no entity class by
  name** (D-168) — type-only exports included, which this batch measured rather than assumed:
  two packages published their entities' row types so the dev seed could name them, and
  `module-package-entity-surface.test.ts` refused both, in as many words — _"that is the one
  thing that makes a foreign module's `import type { … }` compile"_. The exports are gone and
  the seed takes each class off the published array by name.

  **One of the fourteen owns no table and says so with an empty array rather than by
  omission.** `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels` exports `entities: readonly never[] = []`.
  The distinction is not cosmetic: the platform's package loader answers a _missing_ export
  with `[]`, so "this module has no table" and "somebody forgot the array" would otherwise
  arrive as one silence, whose only symptom is a query against a table nobody created.

  **One package publishes a type on `./backend` that is not an entity**, and it is there
  because a composition root has to name a contribution it supplies:
  `@endora-commerce/mod-shopping-lists` re-exports `ShoppingListService`. A root cannot reach
  a package's internal file — `rootDir` makes a relative specifier into `packages/` TS6059
  even for an `import type` — so a contribution shape has to be on a published subpath or it
  is unnameable.

  **Two packages declare a `@fastify/*` dependency nothing imports.**
  `@endora-commerce/mod-mfa` peers on `@fastify/cookie` and `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa` on
  `@fastify/multipart`, because `reply.setCookie`, `request.isMultipart()` and
  `request.file()` are declaration-merging augmentations rather than imports. Inside the
  application those arrived ambiently through the host's own dependency; a package compiles
  against its own manifest, where an unnamed dependency does not exist. Both write
  `import type {} from '@fastify/…'`, which is type-only: the plugin is still the host's to
  register.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter` and `@endora-commerce/mod-pwa` also carry a companion
  `@types/*` in `devDependencies`** — `@types/nodemailer` and `@types/web-push` — which the
  manifest generator now derives. Nothing imports a `@types` package; the compiler finds it
  through `node_modules/@types`, which inside a package is the package's own declaration, so
  a module importing a JS-only library did not build until this landed.

- 5ec39db: `newsletter` gains `organization_id` on `newsletter_subscribers`, stamps it on
  both writes that own a row, and refuses a row that names a customer account
  without one.

  `NewsletterSubscriber` gains an `organizationId` property and the
  `newsletter_subscribers` table gains a nullable `organization_id` column, an
  index (`newsletter_subscribers_organization_idx`, following this table's own
  `newsletter_subscribers_channel_idx` spelling) and
  `check ("customer_account_id" is null or "organization_id" is not null)`. The
  migration first derives the missing organisation from the account that owns each
  subscriber, then refuses — with the count and up to twenty ids, deleting nothing
  — anything it could not derive. Like `push_subscriptions` and
  `availability_notifications`, and unlike `comparisons`, this table carries **no
  foreign key** on `customer_account_id`, so that refusal is a branch a real
  database can reach.

  **The e-mail address is not a derivation, and that is a decision rather than an
  omission.** `newsletter_subscribers.email` is globally unique and
  `customer_accounts` has an `email` too, so the backfill could have matched them
  and attributed far more rows. Matching would claim rows the schema does not
  link, silently and irreversibly, for whoever signed up with the address their
  employer later registered. The only derivation is `customer_account_id`.

  **What changes for a reader.** `NewsletterSubscriber` is `@CustomerScoped`, and
  the tenant filter's `allowed-set` arm consults the ORM's metadata for this
  property per query. Before this release the arm found none and refused the whole
  table, so an administrator whose authority is a set of organisations — a sales
  representative — was shown no subscribers at all and told so, through the
  `ORGANIZATION_ATTRIBUTION_PENDING` notice on the response envelope. It now grants
  on the column, so that administrator sees the subscribers of the organisations
  they are assigned to, and the notice stops being emitted for this table.

  **And that reaches the CSV export, which is the surface with no envelope.**
  `GET /api/v1/admin/newsletter/subscribers/export` answers with a `text/csv`
  body, so the notice could never be attached to it: a scoped administrator's
  download was a header row and nothing else, with nothing anywhere saying why. It
  now carries their organisations' owned subscribers. It carries **no ownerless
  subscriber** — every storefront sign-up, which on this table is the ordinary row
  rather than the edge — because such a row has no organisation and the constraint
  is an implication rather than an equivalence. Who an ownerless subscriber belongs
  to is an open product question this release does not answer; it lands the column
  that makes any answer expressible.

  **What changes for a caller.** `SubscriberServiceDeps` gains a **required**
  `customerAccounts: CustomerAccountReadPort`, and `NewsletterModuleOptions` gains
  the same field, threaded from the container's `customerAccountReadPort`. A
  composition that cannot answer "which organisation owns this account" can no
  longer construct `NewsletterSubscriberService` — that is the point, since the
  constraint refuses the row it would write. Both write sites take the two columns
  from one resolved-owner value, so the customer branch has no shape in which the
  organisation could be omitted and the anonymous branch has none to carry.

### Patch Changes

- 6f5687c: These four packages now declare a `test` script and ship a `vitest.config.ts`, so the unit
  tests they already carried beside their sources are collected and run.

  They were not. `specs/deferred-defects.md`'s _"Co-located tests inside a module package run
  nowhere"_ is the entry this closes: no vitest configuration included `packages/**` and no
  module package declared a test command, so fifteen files across these four packages were
  collected by no run, reported by no job and counted in no total. They were not failing —
  as far as the pipeline was concerned they did not exist, which in review reads as coverage.
  All fifteen pass on first collection: 103 tests, and the CI job that will now run them,
  `test:frontend`, goes from 229 files / 1240 tests to 244 / 1343.

  **If you consume one of these packages**, nothing you import changes: `files` still ships
  `dist` and `i18n`, `tsconfig.build.json` still roots the emit at `src/`, and the test files
  and the configuration are in neither. The only difference is that `pnpm test` inside the
  package now does something.

  **If you write a module package**, two rules now hold and are enforced rather than
  documented:
  - The generated `test` script is a bare `vitest run` — never `--passWithNoTests`. Measured
    on vitest 2.1.9 over a package with no test file, bare `run` exits 1 with _"No test files
    found"_ and the flag turns that into 0. A package that declares a runner and collects
    nothing must fail, or the repair reproduces the defect it fixes.
  - `manifests:generate` and `manifests:check` **refuse** a package that holds a test file and
    declares no `vitest.config.ts`, naming the file. That is what stops the gap reopening
    silently for the next package.

  A package's `vitest.config.ts` must `mergeConfig` the repository root's
  `vitest.config.base.ts`: that is where issue #255's foreign-workspace-link refusal lives,
  and a configuration that skips it can execute another checkout's sources while reporting on
  this branch.

- 5d9bb88: Error-code ownership: Tier B's six already-bundled modules declare the codes they own, and eight
  placeholder sentences leave the platform bundle.

  `manifest.errorCodes` gains seven codes on `@endora-commerce/mod-customer-accounts`
  (`ACCOUNT_BLOCKED`, `CANNOT_DEMOTE_LAST_ADMIN`, `CANNOT_REMOVE_LAST_ADMIN` and the four
  `CUSTOMER_*` record codes), six on `@endora-commerce/mod-catalog` (`BULK_TOO_LARGE`, the three
  `PACKAGING_UNIT_*` codes, `SELECTION_TOO_LARGE`, `SYSTEM_ATTRIBUTE_SET_IMMUTABLE`), three on
  `@endora-commerce/mod-orders` (`CURRENCY_MISMATCH`, `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REQUIRED`,
  `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED`), two on `@endora-commerce/mod-mfa` (`TWO_FACTOR_REQUIRED`,
  `TWO_FACTOR_REQUIRED_BY_ROLE`), one on `@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter`
  (`ALREADY_SUBSCRIBED`) and one on `@endora-commerce/mod-promotions` (`PROMOTION_INVALID`);
  `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n` drops the same twenty from its own declaration, which is what
  decides where the error envelope looks for a sentence (D-129's remaining sweep, MR 4 of eight;
  D-121 tiers T1 and T2; D-186 §1 and §2 in `specs/080-f4-real-scope/rulings.md`;
  `specs/090-module-owned-error-codes/d129-sweep.md`).

  `@endora-commerce/mod-customer-accounts`, `@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-promotions` declare an error code for the first time. No wire shape moves:
  `error.code` is unchanged for all twenty.

  **Eight sentences are deleted from `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`'s bundle, and this is
  operator-visible.** Each was the error code rewritten twice — `"Currency Mismatch."` in `en` and
  `"Błąd: currency mismatch."` in `pl` — which D-186 §2 refuses to carry into a module's own
  bundle, where it would read as that module's answer rather than as an unwritten sentence. Four
  of the eight are replaced by real prose in both languages in the receiving module's own bundle:
  - `errors.SYSTEM_ATTRIBUTE_SET_IMMUTABLE` in `@endora-commerce/mod-catalog`
  - `errors.CANNOT_DEMOTE_LAST_ADMIN` and `errors.CANNOT_REMOVE_LAST_ADMIN` in
    `@endora-commerce/mod-customer-accounts`
  - `errors.CURRENCY_MISMATCH` in `@endora-commerce/mod-orders`

  The other four — `TWO_FACTOR_REQUIRED`, `TWO_FACTOR_REQUIRED_BY_ROLE`, `ALREADY_SUBSCRIBED` and
  `PROMOTION_INVALID` — are codes nothing in the platform raises, so there was no refusal to
  describe and the placeholder is deleted without a replacement. A consumer that reads those keys
  out of `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`'s bundle directly will no longer find them; nothing in the
  platform produced the codes they belonged to.
