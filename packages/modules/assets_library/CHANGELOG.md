# @endora-commerce/mod-assets-library

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 27ca81d: `assets_library` and `custom_fields` ship their admin surfaces.

  **New `./admin` subpath on both packages.** `@endora-commerce/mod-assets-library` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-custom-fields` each export `contributions` — an `AdminContributions`
  object — from `@endora-commerce/mod-<id>/admin`, and nothing else. Each declares one route
  and one sidebar entry; the route components are dynamic-import factories, so a consumer's
  bundler emits one chunk per screen. The routes are unchanged: `/assets-library` and
  `/custom-fields`, gated on `assets.read` and `custom_fields:read` respectively — the codes
  the hand-written host registrations carried.

  Four things a consumer has to know about that half:
  - **The subpath needs a build.** `./admin` resolves at `dist/admin/index.js`, emitted by
    each package's new `tsconfig.ui.json`; a checkout that has not run
    `pnpm run build:packages` cannot resolve it. Both packages' `build` and `typecheck`
    scripts now run two `tsc` invocations.
  - **`@endora-commerce/admin-kit`, `react` and `lucide-react` become peer dependencies of
    both**, and `react-router-dom` of `mod-custom-fields`. The kit is where every screen's
    design-system import resolves; `react` is peered rather than depended on so the
    application resolves one copy.
  - **Each package's `i18n/` bundle gains its own `nav.*.label`** — `nav.assetsLibrary.label`
    and `nav.customFields.label` — resolved in the module's own namespace instead of the
    shared `core` one. `appShell.nav.assetsLibrary` and `appShell.nav.customFields` are
    removed from `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`'s bundle with the host rows that named them.
  - **`mod-custom-fields`' screen no longer reads the `core` namespace at all.** It rendered
    `customFields.title` and `customFields.description` out of the shared bundle beside four
    keys of its own; both were already written in this package's `i18n/{en,pl}.json`, so the
    shared reads were a second copy of two strings. `customFields.title` and
    `customFields.save` stay in `mod-i18n` because `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`'s
    `CustomFieldValuesPanel` renders them.

  **One repair inside `mod-assets-library`, and it is a deduplication a consumer can see.**
  `AssetDetailDrawer` carried a private `toAbsoluteAssetUrl` over its own
  `import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL` read with a `http://localhost:3001` fallback — a
  fourteenth copy of the function `@endora-commerce/admin-kit/lib` publishes. It takes the
  kit's now, which is the binding `LibraryPage` two files away was already taking. There is
  one implementation of it in the tree again.

  **Nothing is removed and no existing export changes shape**, so a consumer of either
  package's `./backend`, `./migrations`, `./ports` or root subpath is unaffected. Both
  modules declare `activation.nonDeactivatable`, so neither gains an operator-facing switch:
  what the new subpath adds is where the screens live, not whether they can be withdrawn.

- e637f56: Seven more modules become workspace packages (feature 080, T040b batch four):
  `assets_library`, `carts`, `custom_fields`, `customers`, `email`, `invoices` and
  `settings`. Each ships `dist` and resolves through its own `exports` map — the
  root for its manifest, `./backend` for `registerModule` plus the `entities`
  array, `./migrations` for its migration classes where it owns any — exactly as
  the forty-three packages before them.

  Three things a consumer of one of these packages should know.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-carts`, `@endora-commerce/mod-custom-fields` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-invoices` publish a `./ports` subpath.** It is type-only:
  `tsc` emits `export {};`, and it is where a consumer names
  `CartPlacementApplyPort`, `CustomFieldDefinitionApplyApi` and
  `InvoicePlacementApplyPort` instead of reaching into the owner's directory.

  ```ts
  import type { CartPlacementApplyPort } from '@endora-commerce/mod-carts/ports';
  ```

  The implementations stay behind their container names
  (`cartPlacementApplyPort`, `customFieldDefinitionApplyApi`,
  `invoicePlacementApplyPort`) and are resolved with `lazyPort`, never through
  this subpath.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-settings` declares `entities` as an empty array.** The
  module owns no table — the settings store is the platform's — and the empty
  array is the statement, because the host reads a _missing_ export as `[]` and a
  forgotten one would be indistinguishable from an honest none.

  **No entity class is exported by name from any of the seven**, `import type`
  included (D-168). A consumer that must construct one takes it off the published
  `entities` array by name; `Cart`, `Invoice` and the rest are deliberately not
  importable.

### Patch Changes

- e969343: `assets_library` declares the fifteen error codes it owns.

  `manifest.ts` gains an `errorCodes` array — feature 090 Phase 3
  (`specs/090-module-owned-error-codes/`). Nothing the package exports changes
  shape. The observable difference for a consumer is that this module's error
  sentences are now routed by its own declaration rather than only by the prefix
  chain in `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`, which continues to answer identically for
  every one of them: the list is the chain's own answer, copied from the frozen
  capture, and is asserted equal to it in both directions.

  No `tokens` are declared: none of the fifteen carries a refusal discriminator.
  `ASSET_KIND_NOT_SUPPORTED` is not here — it carries this module's prefix and is
  `catalog`'s, which declares it.

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.
