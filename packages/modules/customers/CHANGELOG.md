## 0.110.0

### Minor Changes

- 34485ae: Customers by organization role (`specs/170-organization-roles/`, WP-03).

  - The depletion guard (`409 ORG_OWNER_DEPLETION`) on blocking, deleting and detaching a customer protects the last active holder of a **company** organization's _Administrator_ role, read from the role rather than the legacy `role` column. Blocked administrators no longer count on any of the three paths (deletion and detaching counted them before), so deleting or detaching the last unblocked administrator is refused. Blocking or deleting a personal organization's member is no longer refused.
  - `GET /api/v1/me/customer` answers `organizationRole` and `permissions`; the impersonation start answers `impersonatedCustomerAccount.organizationRole`.
  - `CustomerModerationService` and `CustomerDeletionService` take an `OrganizationDepletionGuard` as their last constructor argument; `customersModule` requires `organizationPermissionPort` and an `organizationRoleReadPort` that also answers `roleRef`.

- 9bfb0b8: The legacy two-value organization role is removed (`specs/170-organization-roles/`, WP-12). Breaking for every consumer that still names it. A member holds a role **id**, and what they may do follows from that role's permissions. Old → new:

  - `organizationRoleSchema` and `OrganizationRole` (`'organization_admin' | 'regular_user'`, from `common.ts`) are removed. Use `OrganizationRoleRef` (`{ id, name, kind }`) and `OrganizationRoleKind` (`administrator`, `member`, `custom`) instead.
  - `CustomerAccountRole` is removed, and so are `CustomerAccountRecord.role` and `CustomerAccountCreateInput.role`. Read and write `organizationRoleId` instead; it is required on create.
  - `CustomerAccountReadPort.countByOrganizationRole(organizationId, role, options)` is removed. Use `countAdministrators(organizationId, options)`, which takes the same options. `listByOrganization` still answers the Organization's _Administrator_ holders first, then by creation date.
  - `CustomerRolePort.changeRole(organizationId, customerAccountId, newRole)` is removed. Use `customerAccountRoleCommandPort.changeRole({ organizationId, customerAccountId, roleId })`, the `customer_account.change_role` Command. `customerRolePort` keeps `listMembers` and `removeMember`.
  - `RfqCustomerContext.isOrgAdmin` is removed. Ask `OrganizationPermissionPort.isAdministrator(subject)` instead (research R-30). `carts`, `orders`, `quick_order` and `shopping_lists` no longer pass it.
  - `OrganizationRecord.requiresCartApproval`, `OrganizationCartApprovalWritePort` (the container name `organizationCartApprovalWritePort` is no longer registered), `CartApprovalPolicyWriteResult`, `setCartApprovalPolicySchema` / `SetCartApprovalPolicy` and `cartApprovalPolicyResponseSchema` / `CartApprovalPolicyResponse` are removed, together with the `organization.set_cart_approval_policy` Command. Approval now follows the member's `carts.order_without_approval` permission (OR-3), and the policy endpoints were already removed.
  - On responses, `role` is no longer described on `customerAccountSchema`, `customerLoginResponseSchema`'s `customerAccount` or `impersonationStartResponseSchema`'s `impersonatedCustomerAccount`. `organizationRole` is now **required** on all three, and `permissions` is required on the first two: every producer sends them. `POST /api/v1/admin/organizations/:id/impersonate` (`admin_users`) no longer sends `role` and now sends `organizationRole`, read through `organizationRoleReadPort` (an acknowledged dependency on `organizations`); `POST /api/v1/admin/customers/:id/impersonate` (`customers`) always sends it.
  - The request schemas `inviteMemberRequestSchema` (`{ email, role? }`), `changeMemberRoleRequestSchema` (`{ role }`), `adminDirectMemberRequestSchema` (`role?`) and `adminPatchMemberRoleRequestSchema` (`{ role, expectedUpdatedAt? }`) are removed. Use `inviteMemberToRoleRequestSchema`, `assignMemberRoleRequestSchema`, `adminDirectMemberToRoleRequestSchema` and `adminAssignMemberRoleRequestSchema`, which take `roleId`. They stay strict, so a body that still sends `role` is refused with `400`.
  - The customers CSV export (`import_export`) carries `organization_role_name` (a predefined role's English label, or a custom role's name) and `organization_role_kind` (`administrator`, `member`, `custom`) in place of its `role` column. It reads them through `organizationRoleReadPort`, a new non-binding `degrades-without` edge on `organizations`. The export is export-only, so no import is affected.
  - `carts`' published bundles (`i18n/en.json`, `i18n/pl.json`) drop five unread keys that described the removed policy and the administrator-only approval: `approval.banner.pending`, `approval.banner.rejected`, `approval.banner.policy_on`, `approval.banner.policy_off` and `reject.email.body`.
  - The `CustomerAccount` entity loses `role`. `Organization` loses `requiresCartApproval`, and `OrganizationInvitation` loses `role`, so its `organizationRoleId` is now required. Nothing writes the legacy value any more.
  - New migrations `Migration20261104T094535OrganizationsDropLegacyRoleColumns` (M4) and `Migration20261104T094540CustomerAccountsDropLegacyRoleColumn` (M5):
    - M4 drops `organizations.requires_cart_approval`, `organization_invitations.role` and the invitation default trigger that read it.
    - M5 drops `customer_accounts.role` with its index.
    - M5 also redefines the account default: an account inserted without a role holds _Administrator_ in a personal Organization, else _Member_.
    - Each `down()` re-derives the dropped values from the role reference.

- 270aa2b: **Breaking:** the personal address book is retired for everyone (`specs/173-b2c-address-book-merge/` release 1 of 2).

  - Every former personal-address-book endpoint answers `410 Gone` with `CUSTOMER_ADDRESS_BOOK_RETIRED`, in Polish or English: `GET`/`POST /api/v1/me/customer/addresses`, `PATCH`/`DELETE /api/v1/me/customer/addresses/:addressId`, `PUT /api/v1/me/customer/addresses/:addressId/default`, `POST /api/v1/admin/customers/:id/addresses`, and a `PUT /api/v1/me/customer/defaults` whose body carries `billingAddressId` or `shippingAddressId`. Manage addresses on `/api/v1/organizations/mine/addresses`.
  - `GET /api/v1/me/customer/defaults` (and the admin customer detail's `defaults`) reports the default addresses of the customer's Organization book.
  - `GET /api/v1/admin/customers/:id/addresses` answers `{ organization, personal }`, where `personal` lists only the rows the retirement job refused, each with `mergeRefusal`.
  - The `customerAddressReadPort` port is no longer published.
  - A one-time BullMQ job (`customers.address-book-retirement`, run by the worker process while `customers` is on) moves every live B2C personal-book row into the customer's personal Organization's book without duplicates, keeping an existing Organization default, and erases every other live row — a company member's, one of an individual whose personal Organization was already anonymized, or one of an account with no Organization. The summary it logs counts the last as `erasedWithoutOrganization` and warns when there are any. Each row is audited; a row `addresses` refuses stays live with its reason. A migration adds the provenance columns it writes. The package now peers on `bullmq` and `ioredis`.
  - The retention sweep also blanks and soft-deletes a scrubbed personal Organization's saved addresses.

- a41e6ac: The customer's _Addresses_ card in the Admin UI (`AddressesPanel`) is read-only (`specs/173-b2c-address-book-merge/`, OD-6). It lists the customer's Organization address book, then any personal-book row the retirement job refused, with its reason. The add form is gone, and so are its bundle keys `detail.addresses.recipient`, `.street`, `.city`, `.postal`, `.country` and `.add`. New keys: `detail.addresses.organizationBook`, `.refused`, `.refusedHint` and `.refusalReason`. The module page documents the retired personal book.
- dac5795: The storefront can read whether individual self-registration is offered before it renders the form (issue #756). `customers` adds the public `GET /api/v1/storefront/settings/customer-registration`, which answers `{ data: { allowRegistrationWithoutOrganization } }` from `customers.allow_registration_without_organization`, the same answer `POST /api/v1/customers/register` applies. Its shape is `customerRegistrationOptionsResponseSchema` in the contracts. `CustomerRegistrationService` gains `allowsStandalone()`, and `registerStandalone` now uses it. The response is not cached.
- 54ad556: `customers.allow_registration_without_organization` is now read for the request's sales channel (issue #773). `POST /api/v1/customers/register` and `GET /api/v1/storefront/settings/customer-registration` (through `CustomerRegistrationService.allowsStandalone()`) resolve the value set for the channel the request resolves to, then the all-channels value, then the manifest default (`false`). Until now both read the system-default channel's value and applied it to every channel, so a value set only for another channel had no effect.

  **Behaviour change on upgrade.** An installation that enabled the setting only for its default channel had B2C registration on every channel; after this release it has it only on the default channel, and its other channels refuse standalone registration with `REGISTRATION_REQUIRES_ORGANIZATION`. To keep the previous behaviour, set the value for all channels, or for each channel that should offer it, on the admin settings screen.

  **Federated sign-up (`mod-customer-accounts`).** A first sign-in through an external identity provider (`GET /api/v1/auth/customer/oauth/:provider/callback`) creates an account through `customerSocialLoginPort.autoCreate`, which now reads the same setting for the channel the sign-in was started on (the channel `SocialIdentityService` carries out of the OAuth transaction) instead of the system-default channel. Where the setting is off for that channel the sign-in answers `registration_required` and creates no account; a caller that names no channel gets no account either. The same upgrade note applies: federated sign-up stops on every channel that does not have the setting on.

  **Outside a request** (no resolved sales channel), the `mod-customers` registration gate now answers `false` rather than the system-default channel's value. `customers.deletion_retention_days` and `customers.presence_freshness_minutes` still read the system-default channel.

- 8ad737c: The admin sub-resources of a customer that does not exist answer `404 CUSTOMER_NOT_FOUND`, as the customer itself and a malformed id do (issue #794). Before, `PATCH …/custom-fields` and `POST …/impersonate` answered `404 NOT_FOUND`, and `GET …/addresses`, `…/orders`, `…/quote-requests` and `…/carts` answered `200` with empty lists. A customer outside a scoped operator's reach reads as absent, so it now answers the same `404`. The permission is still judged first: a caller without `customers:impersonate` is refused `403` whether or not the customer exists. The retired `POST …/addresses` answers `410 CUSTOMER_ADDRESS_BOOK_RETIRED` to every caller holding `customers:manage`, whatever the id (`specs/173-b2c-address-book-merge/` FR-005); a malformed id there answered `404 CUSTOMER_NOT_FOUND` before.
- a9398c8: The customer anonymization sweep is restartable (issue #800). It now scrubs a personal organization, then its saved addresses, and anonymizes the account last, so an account whose cascade was interrupted stays due and the next run completes it. Each account runs on its own: one that fails no longer stops the run, which anonymizes the others and then throws once, naming the failed account ids. A `ModuleDisabledError` still aborts the run.

  `PersonalOrganizationPort.anonymizeIfOrphaned` is convergent. It writes only the part of the scrub that is still missing, keeps an existing `deletedAt` (an operator's soft-delete), and records `organization.anonymized` in the same transaction as the scrub, only when something changed. It answers the organization on a repeat call too, and answers `null` only for an org-less account, a non-personal organization, or one that still has a live member.

  `POST /api/v1/admin/customers/:id/restore` answers `409 CUSTOMER_RESTORE_WINDOW_ELAPSED` once `customers.deletion_retention_days` has elapsed since the deletion, even before the sweep has anonymized the account. It used to succeed in that case. `CustomerDeletionService` takes the retention-days resolver as a new constructor argument. `CUSTOMER_RESTORE_WINDOW_ELAPSED` now has a sentence in English and Polish in `customer_accounts`' bundle, so both raise sites answer in the reader's language.

### Patch Changes

- a206da9: Assigning a customer to another organization, or detaching them to their own personal organization, writes the role they hold there with the move (`specs/170-organization-roles/`, WP-02b): a company's _Administrator_ stays _Administrator_ in the target, anyone else becomes its _Member_, and a detached customer is their personal organization's _Administrator_.
- 9b87711: Soft-deleted customer accounts are now anonymized once `customers.deletion_retention_days` has elapsed (issue #677). `AnonymizationSweepWorker.sweep()` had no caller, so a deleted account kept its personal data indefinitely and `customer_account.anonymized.v1` was never announced. The module now installs a daily BullMQ Job Scheduler (`customers.anonymization.sweep`, idempotent across restarts and replicas) and consumes it through `ctx.worker` in processes that run workers, so no run happens while `customers` is off.

  **Behaviour change on upgrade.** The first worker boot after the upgrade installs the schedule, and its first run starts immediately: every soft-deleted account already older than `customers.deletion_retention_days` (default 365) is anonymized within minutes, irreversibly. To keep any of them, raise `customers.deletion_retention_days` before upgrading, for all channels or at least the default channel, and restore them; once the window has passed, restore is refused. See _Deleted customer accounts are anonymized on schedule_ in the upgrade guide, which has a query to count the accounts due.

- d24be0e: The module documentation pages have readable titles instead of the module id (for example _Carts_ instead of `carts`), in the docs sidebar, the module map and the browser tab, in English and Polish. Page headings and screen names in the page text are sentence case, as in the Admin UI (#795). File names and URLs are unchanged.
- 57145f7: The customer anonymization sweep now erases the reasons operators wrote about the customer (issue #843). `PersonalOrganizationPort.anonymizeIfOrphaned` sets a personal organization's `blockedReason` and `rejectedReason` to `null`; `CustomerAccountLifecycleWritePort.anonymize` sets the account's `blockReason` to `null`. The block or rejection itself is kept: the status, `blockedAt`, `rejectedAt`, `blockSource` and who applied the block. A company organization keeps its reasons.

  The audit entries record only whether a reason existed: `organization.anonymized` gains `stateBefore.hadBlockedReason` and `stateBefore.hadRejectedReason`, and `customer_account.anonymized` gains `stateBefore.hadBlockReason`. None of them stores the reason text.

  A subject anonymized by an earlier release is finished on the next sweep run. `CustomerAccountLifecycleWritePort.listDueForAnonymization` now also lists an anonymized account that still has a block reason or custom field values (left by a scrub before #802), whatever the retention cutoff, so raising `customers.deletion_retention_days` cannot strand it. For such an account, `anonymize` clears what is left and writes one more `customer_account.anonymized` entry. That entry's `stateBefore.anonymizedAt` is the original anonymization time, where the first scrub's is `null`; `hadBlockReason` and `customFieldKeys` say what was left. It keeps `anonymizedAt` and does not announce `customer_account.anonymized.v1` again. A personal organization with a reason left is finished whenever the sweep reaches its account.

  The `customers` module page now describes this, and says that audit entries written earlier keep the reason they recorded until #844 ships.

- 58a1632: The retention sweep erases the anonymised customer's audit history in place, through the platform's `auditRedactionService` (issue #844). This covers the rows about the account, and for an individual also the rows about their personal Organization, every address of it (deleted ones included) and the account's rows in the retired personal address book. Keys, ids, timestamps, codes, actions, actors and times stay. Personal values, free text and every custom-field value become `"[erased]"`, and so do the IP address and user agent on the rows the customer wrote for themselves. One `audit.redacted` entry is written per subject. The step runs after the organisation and address scrubs and before the account's own scrub, so an interrupted run is finished by the next one. `CustomerDeletionService` takes the history step's dependencies as a ninth constructor argument, and the module reads `auditRedactionService` off its cradle.
- 76d89ab: The daily anonymization sweep no longer enters the system scope when no account is due, so an idle instance stops writing one `tenant.escape_hatch` audit row a day (issue #857).

  - `CustomerAccountLifecycleWritePort` gains `hasDueForAnonymization(cutoff): Promise<boolean>`: whether `listDueForAnonymization(cutoff)` would list anything, answered yes or no over the same predicate. An implementation of the port outside this repository must add it.
  - The sweep tick reads `customers.deletion_retention_days` and asks that question before it enters its scope. A question that fails counts as yes, so the sweep then runs as before.
  - `CustomerAccountLifecycleWritePort.anonymize` locks the account row before it checks `anonymizedAt`, so two overlapping sweep runs anonymize an account once, with one `customer_account.anonymized` audit entry and one `customer_account.anonymized.v1` event.

- ca120cc: Every settings group a module declares now has a translated heading on the Settings screen (#884). Each module's bundle gains `settingGroups.<group code>.name` in English and Polish, so a Polish operator no longer reads group headings such as _Orders_, _Carts_ or _Security / MFA_ in English. `@endora-commerce/mod-admin-notifications` and `@endora-commerce/mod-shipments` ship translation bundles for the first time: their manifests declare `i18n: { bundlesDir: 'i18n' }` and their tarballs carry `i18n/`.
- c34b405: The retention sweep now erases the reasons operators and approvers gave for rejecting the anonymised account's carts, through `carts`' `cartAnonymizationPort`, before the account's own scrub, so an interrupted run is finished by the next one (issue #920). `CustomerDeletionService` takes the port as a ninth constructor argument, and `CustomersModuleOptions` gains `cartAnonymizationPort`.
- 5af8c25: The customer anonymization sweep now finishes every subject an earlier scrub rule left incomplete (issue #923), not only the accounts never anonymized. Until now it picked its work by account, so a personal organization anonymized before the scrub covered its legal name, order-confirmation e-mails, custom field values or block and rejection reasons kept them for good once its account was done.

  `PersonalOrganizationPort` gains `listIncompletelyScrubbed(): Promise<string[]>`: the ids of the personal organizations that carry the scrub's name but not all of the current scrub. It reads only the `organizations` table, ignores the retention cutoff, and agrees field by field with the check `anonymizeIfOrphaned` makes before it writes. An implementation or a test fake of the port must add the method.

  `PersonalOrganizationPort` also gains `hasIncompletelyScrubbed(): Promise<boolean>`, the same rows as a yes-or-no question. The sweep's scheduled tick asks it, outside any tenant scope, when no account is due, so a tick with only organization-side work left is not skipped as idle. If that question fails, the tick runs anyway. An implementation or a test fake of the port must add it too.

  Each sweep run now works through the accounts due for anonymization, then the anonymized member of every organization that method lists, each subject once, through the unchanged cascade. Finishing a subject writes one audit entry for each record it changes, keeps the account's `anonymizedAt` and the organization's `deletedAt`, and announces nothing: no second `customer_account.anonymized.v1`, so Forms does not erase the customer's entries a second time. The next run then finds nothing to do. The count `AnonymizationSweepWorker.sweep()` returns is now the number of subjects processed, finished ones included.

  The `customers` module page now describes this.

- 48f055e: The retention sweep now blanks every row of the anonymised account in the retired personal address book (`customer_addresses`), whether the retirement job moved it, erased it or refused it, or the customer deleted it; each row is audited `customer_address.anonymized` with `customerAccountId`, `kind` and `wasDeleted` only, and keeps its `deletedAt`, `mergedIntoAddressId` and `mergeRefusal`. It runs for every anonymised account, before the account's own scrub, and writes nothing on a repeat run (issue #927). `CustomerDeletionService` takes the retired book as a ninth constructor argument.

## 0.109.0

### Minor Changes

- 61fc321: The storefront language is part of the URL path (`/pl/p/wiertarka`, `/en/p/drill`, issue #396).

  **Upgrade note for operators: existing sales channels keep their addresses.** The migration
  `Migration20261029T152922CoreSalesChannelsPrefixDefaultLanguage` adds the per-channel setting
  _Prefix the default language in URLs_ and switches it **off** on every channel that exists when it
  runs, so default-language URLs stay unprefixed; channels created later start **on**. To adopt
  prefixes for the default language too, switch _Prefix the default language in URLs_ on in
  _Sales channels_ → the channel. Other languages are prefixed either way: a former
  `/p/<key>?lang=<L>` link answers a permanent redirect to `/<prefix>/p/<key>`. A CMS page whose slug
  starts with a channel language prefix can no longer be saved.

  `@endora-commerce/contracts`:

  - New: `channelUrlLanguages`, `channelUrlLanguageAliases`, `storefrontPagePath`,
    `storefrontPagePathFor`, `storefrontDefaultPath`, `channelUrlLanguageSchema`,
    `channelUrlLanguageAliasSchema`, `URL_LANGUAGE_PREFIX_PATTERN`, types `ChannelUrlFacts`,
    `ChannelUrlLanguage`, `ChannelUrlLanguageAlias`; `productDefaultPath(key)`.
  - **`productPath` takes the channel's URL facts and never appends `?lang=`:**
    `productPath({ key, languageCode, channelDefaultLanguage })` (`/p/drill?lang=en-US`) becomes
    `productPath({ key, languageCode, channel })` (`/en/p/drill`), where `channel` is any
    `{ languages, defaultLanguage, prefixDefaultLanguage }` — the cached channel satisfies it.
  - `productKeyResolutionSchema`'s `redirect` requires `permanent` (`false` for a key of another
    channel language, answered 307); `productPagePathsSchema` requires `xDefault`.
  - Sales channel shapes carry `prefixDefaultLanguage` (create defaults to `true`); the public
    channel read answers `prefixDefaultLanguage`, `urlLanguages` and `urlLanguageAliases`.
  - `cmsPageUrl` (163 R24) takes the channel's URL facts and composes the prefixed path:
    `cmsPageUrl({ path, languageCode, channelDefaultLanguage })` (`/about-us?lang=en-US`) becomes
    `cmsPageUrl({ path, languageCode, channel })` (`/en/about-us`). The resolved CMS page's `url` and
    `alternates`, and the storefront page index, therefore carry each language's own slug under its
    prefix.
  - `CmsPageRecord` gains optional `languages` and `translations` (the `seo` sitemap lists each
    language at its own slug); `cmsPageSummarySchema` gains an optional
    `shadowedByLanguagePrefix` (any of the page's slugs, per-language ones included).

  Emitters (catalog, seo sitemap, product feeds, organizations, customers, newsletter, comparisons,
  mfa, invoices) compose prefixed storefront URLs; the product feed `link` uses the product's key in
  the feed language; the invoice e-mail links the storefront order page; the admin password reset
  links `/password-reset/confirm`. `cms-components` localizes block links through the render
  context's `localizePath`.

### Patch Changes

- c99b4cd: The command-palette actions of the commerce modules (`carts`, `catalog`, `comparisons`, `credit_limits`, `customer_accounts`, `customers`, `custom_fields`, `delivery_methods`, `dictionaries`, `document_templates`, `import_export`, `inventory`, `invoice_ledger`, `invoices`, `payment_methods`, `price_lists`, `product_feeds`, `promotions`, `quote_requests`, `sales_channels`, `taxes`) keep only English `keywords` in their manifests. Their Polish search words moved to each module's `i18n/pl.json` under the action's new `keywordsKey`, with an English entry in `i18n/en.json` (issue #573, following #560), and the ones that had been written without diacritics now carry them (`utwórz cennik`, `wyjaśnienie ceny`, `kolejność cen`). A Polish operator finds the same screens by the same words; an English-language admin is no longer offered the Polish ones.
- 5038a3a: Multi-factor sign-in is now called **two-step verification** (Polish: **weryfikacja dwuetapowa**) in every user-facing string, replacing "two-factor authentication", "uwierzytelnianie dwuskładnikowe" and bare "2FA". Identifiers, permission codes (`mfa:reset`, `mfa:manage`), setting keys (`mfa.admin.totp_enforced` and its siblings) and error codes are unchanged.

  - `@endora-commerce/mod-mfa`: the four TOTP setting names (now "Admin UI — allow two-step verification", "Admin UI — enforce two-step verification", "Storefront — allow two-step verification", "Storefront — enforce two-step verification"; the `MFA_DEACTIVATION_BLOCKED` sentence quotes the new name), the English and Polish error sentences, permission labels, the Admin UI account-security screen, the manifest's module, setting and permission descriptions, and the federated sign-in refusal sentence. The `open-security` palette action also matches "two-step verification" / "weryfikacja dwuetapowa"; "two-factor", "2fa" and "dwuskładnikowe" still match.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`: `adminRoles.field.requires2fa`, `adminUsers.column.twoFactor` and `organizations.detail.twoFactor`.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-customers`: the reset actions on the customer list and detail screens.
  - `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`: the sentence shown when an administrator's password sign-in needs a second-step setup.
  - `@endora-commerce/contracts`: the validation message of the MFA disable request body.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-admin-users`, `mod-admin-roles`, `mod-auth`, `mod-customer-accounts`: module documentation pages.

### Patch Changes

- e6f3a78: Unit prices are shown by the one rule of the owner ruling of 2026-10-25: two places when the third and fourth are zero, otherwise the significant places, up to four (`0,0125 zł`, `1,50 zł`, `1,505 zł`); line values and totals keep two.

  - `@endora-commerce/mod-invoices`: the invoice PDF's unit net price column (new `unitMoney` beside `money` in the PDF sections), the admin invoice screen and the template preview.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-carts`, `@endora-commerce/mod-customers`: the admin cart and the customer's cart history.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-comparisons`: a compared product's price on the screen, the canvas and the PDF (`1.50 PLN`, `0.0125 PLN`), where it was rounded to two places.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-crm`: an Opportunity's value of a linked Quote Request adds the quote's line values, each rounded to the cent once, as the quote desk does; it rounded only the sum.
  - `@endora-commerce/cms-components`: the CMS product card's price; the package now depends on `@endora-commerce/contracts` for the rule.

### Minor Changes

- bf9881f: Each module contributes its record type to admin global search (`@endora-commerce/mod-admin-search`).

  | Package              | Record type                           | Fields offered (default in bold)                                                 | Permission                             |
  | -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
  | `mod-orders`         | `orders.order`                        | **number**, **organizationName**, **customer**, billingCompanyName, billingTaxId | `orders:read`                          |
  | `mod-quote-requests` | `quote_requests.quote_request`        | **number**, **organizationName**, **customer**, customerNote                     | `rfqs:handle`                          |
  | `mod-crm`            | `crm.opportunity`                     | **number**, **title**, **organizationName**, description                         | `crm:read`                             |
  | `mod-organizations`  | `organizations.organization`          | **name**, **taxId**, legalName                                                   | `customers:read` or `customers:manage` |
  | `mod-customers`      | `customers.customer`                  | **email**, **name**                                                              | `customers:read`                       |
  | `mod-catalog`        | `catalog.product`, `catalog.category` | **sku**, **name**, slug, quickSearchAttributes; **name**, **slug**               | `catalog:read`                         |

  Every provider applies its own admin list's visibility: sales representatives see only their
  organizations' orders, quote requests, opportunities and customers; organizations follow the
  Organizations list, with a representative's assigned organizations ranked first. Each module declares
  a `contributes-to` edge on `adminSearchProviderRegistry`, so none of them depends on global search and
  none loses its switch. `mod-quote-requests`, `mod-organizations`, `mod-customers` and `mod-catalog`
  now declare `_i18n` in `dependencies` (status labels in the admin's language), and each module's
  bundle gains `adminSearch.*` keys in English and Polish.

## 0.105.0

### Patch Changes

- 0184be5: An e-mail that was only written to the server log is no longer reported as sent. On an instance
  with no `SMTP_URL` the console mailer logs the message and used to answer `{ status: 'sent' }`,
  and the transactional e-mail service answered a constant `sent` of its own, so every module that
  records or reports a delivery recorded one that did not happen.

  **Breaking for a consumer of the two port types — three unions gain a member:**

  - `EmailMailerSendOutcome` gains `{ status: 'logged' }`. The console mailer answers it instead of
    `sent`; the SMTP mailer and `InMemoryMailer` still answer `sent`.
  - `TransactionalSendOutcome` gains `{ status: 'logged' }`, and `TransactionalEmailSender.send`
    passes the transport's `logged` on. A transport's `suppressed` (an already accepted message id)
    is still answered as `sent`, as before.
  - `emailDeliveryStatusSchema` / `EmailDeliveryStatus` gain `'logged'`, and
    `invoiceEmailNotSentReasonSchema` / `InvoiceEmailNotSentReason` gain `'logged'`.

  What to do: code with an exhaustive `switch` over one of these unions, or that passes
  `outcome.status` into a closed union of its own, stops compiling until it handles `logged`; code
  that reads `outcome.reason` after `outcome.status !== 'sent'` must narrow to
  `outcome.status === 'suppressed'` first, because `logged` carries no reason. Code that compares
  with `=== 'sent'` keeps compiling and now treats a logged message as not sent. `logged` is not a
  failure and there is nothing to retry: the same call would log the message again. An own
  implementation of `EmailMailerPort` or `TransactionalEmailSender` needs no change.

  What changes on an instance without a mail server:

  - `email_deliveries` rows are written with `status = 'logged'` instead of `'sent'`. The column is
    a plain `varchar(16)`, so there is no migration; rows written earlier keep `sent`.
  - The order, return, payment-status, shipment and invoice e-mail results answer
    `{ sent: false, reason: 'logged' }`, each with its usual "was not sent" log line. Issuing an
    invoice or re-sending its e-mail from the Admin UI says the e-mail was not sent because no mail
    server is configured, in English and Polish (`invoices.emailNotSent.logged`).
  - A CRM Event reminder is recorded as delivered to the bell alone — or as undeliverable when the
    bell is unavailable too — instead of "bell and e-mail".
  - `POST /api/v1/organizations/register` answers `emailVerificationSent: false` when the
    verification e-mail went through the in-code builder and was only logged.

  No setting, permission or migration changes.

- 560f2e3: More credential changes withdraw the sessions and pending sign-ins obtained before them.

  - **`admin_users create` run again for an existing account** replaces the password, so it now
    ends every session of that account and withdraws its pending second-factor challenges and
    setup tickets, through the same path as a peer reset. The write is audited as
    `admin_user.change_password` with `via: 'cli'` and no acting administrator. Creating a new
    account is unchanged.
  - **Removing a second factor.** Disabling your own two-factor authentication
    (`POST /api/v1/admin/account/mfa/disable`, `POST /api/v1/account/mfa/disable`) ends every other
    session of the account and keeps the one the request was made from. An administrator's reset of
    a customer's second factor (`POST /api/v1/admin/customers/:customerId/mfa/reset`, and the bulk
    route for each account it actually resets) ends every session of that customer. Both withdraw
    the account's pending challenges and setup tickets. Enrolling a factor ends no session, and a
    disable or reset that removes nothing ends none either.
  - **Customer password change** (`POST /api/v1/me/customer/change-password`,
    `POST /api/v1/me/password`) ends every other session of the account and keeps the calling one.
    **Redeeming a reset token** (`POST /api/v1/auth/password-reset/confirm`) ends all of them. Both
    mark every other outstanding reset token of the account as consumed and withdraw its pending
    second-factor challenges and setup tickets.

  In every case the new state is persisted first and the sessions are revoked after it.

  Port changes, all additive: `AuthSessionPort.destroyAllForCustomer` takes an optional
  `{ exceptSessionId }` (`AuthDestroyAllForCustomerOptions`), mirroring `destroyAllForAdmin`;
  `CustomerAuthPort.changePassword` takes an optional fourth argument
  `{ sessionCookieValue }` (`CustomerChangePasswordContext`) naming the session to keep — a caller
  that omits it keeps none. No port member was removed or changed incompatibly.

  Not ports, but changed for anyone constructing these classes directly: `PasswordResetService`'s
  constructor takes the session port as its second argument (the audit port moved to third), and
  `MfaEnrolmentService.disable` returns whether a factor was removed.

- b0c0959: A customer or address id that is not a UUID answers `404` instead of `500`. Every
  `/api/v1/admin/customers/:id…` route handed its path parameter to the database unchecked, so a
  mistyped URL such as `GET /api/v1/admin/customers/not-a-uuid` came back as
  `invalid input syntax for type uuid` behind an `INTERNAL` error. These routes now answer the same
  `404 CUSTOMER_NOT_FOUND` they give an unknown customer, after the permission check, so an anonymous
  caller still gets `401`. The self-service address routes
  (`PATCH`/`DELETE /api/v1/me/customer/addresses/:addressId` and `PUT …/default`) had the same
  omission and now answer `404 CUSTOMER_ADDRESS_NOT_FOUND`.

  One visible difference beyond the status code: the read-only panels
  (`…/:id/addresses`, `/orders`, `/quote-requests`, `/carts`) answer `404` for a malformed id while
  still answering `200` with empty lists for a well-formed id no customer has.

  No setting or permission changes.

  migrations by a retired numbering (`024_settings_init.ts`, "migration 102", `080_returns_init.ts`
  and others), which matches no file in any package. Each reference now gives the real
  timestamped filename, such as `20260611T140346_catalog_product_value_overrides_init.ts`, and
  says which module owns it where that is a different module. The organizations page also no
  longer claims that the `suspended` → `blocked` migration writes an audit-log entry: it writes
  an explanatory `blocked_reason` on each remapped row.

## 0.101.1

### Patch Changes

- 69a3717: The `fastify` peer is now `^5.11.0` instead of `^5`, so an install can no longer resolve Fastify 5.0–5.10. On those versions an async route handler that calls `reply.send()` without `return` throws `ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT` as an uncaught exception from Fastify's onSend hook runner, and the process crash-loops; Fastify 5.11.0 catches that error and the server keeps running. An instance scaffolded by `endora new instance` now declares `fastify@^5.11.0` as well. Nothing to do on upgrade unless your project pins Fastify below 5.11 — move it to `^5.11.0` (the repository itself runs 5.12.5).

### Patch Changes

- 8f61a6b: Every published package now ships its own `LICENSE` and `README.md`.

  npm force-includes a file named `LICENSE` into the tarball exactly as it does `README.md`,
  whatever `files` says, so the text has to be in the package directory and not only at the
  repository root — `LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md` states that rule and, until this release, no package
  obeyed it. Measured on `master`: **0** of the 82 publishable packages carried a `LICENSE` and
  **14** carried a `README.md`, so every tarball shipped without licence text and 68 registry
  pages would have rendered empty.

  Both files are **generated**, by `pnpm --filter backend run manifests:generate`, and refused
  when stale by `manifests:check` in the `quality` job:
  - the `LICENSE` is the repository's root `LICENSE`, copied verbatim — the same single source
    the `license: MIT` field is already rendered from. A package that declares a licence of its
    own in the `SEE LICENSE IN <file>` form is skipped and keeps the file it names.
  - the `README.md` is rendered from what the package's own manifest declares: its description,
    its module id where it has one, every published subpath with what that layer holds, its peer
    dependencies with the optional ones marked, the locales its `i18n/` carries and what the
    tarball ships. A `README.md` **without** the generated marker on its first line is a human's
    and is never rewritten — the fourteen that existed are untouched.

  Five module packages also get their npm description back. `@endora-commerce/mod-blog`,
  `mod-credit-limits`, `mod-dhl-parcel`, `mod-google-analytics` and `mod-quote-requests` carried
  the note written when they were moved out of `backend/src/modules` — _"the first module to
  leave backend/src/modules … the manifest id stays identity of record"_ — as the sentence a
  registry shows under the package name. Each now carries the sentence its own module manifest
  declares, which is where `descriptionFor` seeds one from in the first place.

  No API changes, no new dependency, no behaviour change: what moves is what the tarball carries
  and what a package page says.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 0eeb9b5: Require Node >= 22.18.0.

  The previous floor was 22.17.0, which MikroORM 7 sets. 22.18.0 is the first release that
  strips TypeScript types without a flag, and that is what loads a deployment's overlay module:
  in a scaffolded instance `apps/` is outside every compiled member, so the unit the platform
  `import()`s is the client's own `.ts`. On 22.17.x that import throws
  `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` and the process dies before it listens. Emitting a `.js` beside
  the client's source was measured and refused — the overlay loader resolves `.js` before `.ts`
  while the divergence derivation admits both, so the sibling doubles every seam site in the
  report.

  Derived by probing 22.17.0, 22.17.1, 22.18.0 and 22.19.0 against a `.ts` module imported with
  no flag; 22.18.0 is the lowest that loads it.

  If you run 22.17.x, upgrade to 22.18 or later. Nothing else in these packages changed.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 8e86e55: Eleven container names a module read and nothing defaulted are now defaulted by
  the module that reads them, so a composition that contributes nothing can
  resolve every one of them.

  `@endora-commerce/platform` — `composeApp` registers two more names:
  `customerOrganizationIdResolver`, the tenth actor-shaped name, whose value
  expression reads `request.actor` and nothing else; and `newsletterTokenSecret`,
  the resolved `NEWSLETTER_TOKEN_SECRET`.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-newsletter` — `newsletterModule`'s `defaultChannelId`
  option becomes `resolveDefaultChannelId: () => Promise<string | null>`. A
  consumer composing the module through `registerModule` is unaffected; a consumer
  calling `newsletterModule` directly passes `async () => null` where it passed
  `null`. The `NewsletterBridge` interface is removed — the module reads its nine
  members itself.

  `mod-catalog`, `mod-customers`, `mod-ksef`, `mod-orders`, `mod-quote-requests` —
  each registers the names it reads. No published shape changes; a composition
  that contributes one of them still overrides the default, which is what the
  contribution window is for.

  `mod-catalog`, `mod-customers` and `mod-orders` declare new manifest edges for
  ports they now resolve themselves: `catalog` -> `search:searchReindexPort`,
  `customers` -> `admin_roles`, `orders` -> `admin_users` and `admin_roles`. Every
  one of those owners declares `activation.nonDeactivatable`, so no operator loses
  an activation control.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- e27bf6c: Every package that ships scannable UI now publishes its own Tailwind `@source`
  declarations at a new `./tailwind.css` subpath.

  A host compiling this package's utility classes no longer has to know where the
  package's sources are. Import the subpath from the stylesheet that builds your
  admin, and the package names its own layers:

  ```css
  @import 'tailwindcss';
  @import '@endora-commerce/mod-blog/tailwind.css';
  ```

  `@source` resolves relative to the stylesheet that declares it, so the paths hold
  wherever the package is installed. The file is generated from the package's layer
  inventory, ships in the tarball beside `package.json`, and its `dist` line is the one
  that matters to you — the `src` line beside it is inert in a published package and
  exists so that a checkout of this repository keeps scanning source in `dev`.

  **Nothing is removed or renamed**: every existing subpath resolves exactly as before.
  What is new is the obligation on the _host_ side, and it is a build error rather than a
  silent one. Before this, a host reached these packages with a glob over the monorepo
  (`@source "../../packages/**"`), which named a directory no installed tree has —
  and Tailwind reports nothing at all about a source that matches nothing, so such a host
  built green and rendered every screen unstyled. A host that now names a package that is
  not installed gets `Can't resolve`, and one whose tarball omits the file gets
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.

  `@endora-commerce/cms-components` deliberately does **not** publish this subpath. It
  ships a finished, prefixed stylesheet at `./styles.css` and must not also be scanned by
  its host.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- f11ccdb: `customers`, `organizations` and `sales_channels` ship their admin screens, and two icon names
  join the allowlist.

  **Three packages' `./admin` subpath gains `routes` and `nav`, and two of them gain the subpath
  itself.** `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels/admin` already exported `contributions` with a
  `zones` array and nothing else; it now declares its screens there too. `@endora-commerce/mod-customers`
  and `@endora-commerce/mod-organizations` had no `./admin` subpath at all and now declare one.
  Eight routes and six sidebar entries between them, at the paths and codes the hand-written host
  registrations carried. The exported symbol is the same one every other module package uses —
  `contributions`, an `AdminContributions` object, and nothing else — so a consumer already
  reading `sales_channels`' zones needs no edit.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-customers` — **new `./admin` subpath**, exporting `contributions`.
    `/customers` (the landing route), `/customers/online` and `/customers/:id`, all on
    `customers:read`, which is the code every `GET` behind them enforces; the detail screen keeps
    gating its block, unblock, impersonate, delete and restore controls on `customers:manage`
    inside itself. Two sidebar rows, in the `customers` section at weights 100 and 200. The detail
    screen is reached from the roster and has no row of its own. `CustomerDetail` renders the
    `customer.detail.after` zone, which is unchanged.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-organizations` — **new `./admin` subpath**, exporting `contributions`.
    `/organizations` and `/organizations/:id`, both on the **any-of pair**
    `['customers:read', 'customers:manage']`, which is what
    `requireAdminAny(['customers:read', 'customers:manage'])` enforces on every organization
    endpoint. `AdminNavDeclaration.requiredPermission` and `AdminRouteDeclaration.requiredPermission`
    both take a `PermissionRequirement`, so the pair is declared rather than collapsed: naming only
    the read code hides the screen from a role holding just `customers:manage`. One sidebar row, in
    the `customers` section at weight 300. `OrganizationDetail` renders the
    `organization.detail.after` zone — four modules contribute there — and that is unchanged.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels` — `/sales-channels` and `/sales-channels/:code` on
    `sales_channels:read`, and `/sales-channels/new` on `sales_channels:write`. **That last one is a
    behaviour change for a consumer rendering these routes**: the create form is a screen whose only
    purpose is a write, `POST /api/v1/admin/sales-channels` enforces `sales_channels:write`, and the
    module's own `new-sales-channel` palette action already advertised that code. It was ungated
    while the route was the admin application's, so an operator holding only `sales_channels:read`
    could open a form whose save then refused; the roster's _+ New channel_ button is gated on the
    same code in this release, so the dead end is closed at both ends. `credentials` ships the
    identical split for `/credentials/new`. One sidebar row, in the `channels` section at weight 100.
    `SalesChannelEditPage` renders the `sales_channel.editor.after` zone, which is unchanged.

  **`@endora-commerce/contracts` — two members join `KnownIconNameSchema`: `Building2` and
  `Store`.** They are the glyphs the admin application drew for `/organizations` and
  `/sales-channels` by hand. A contribution names its icon rather than importing it, so a name that
  is not on the allowlist degrades to the fallback; adding them is what keeps the two rows looking
  as they did. Widening an enum is additive for a consumer validating against it and breaking for
  one exhaustively switching over `KnownIconName` — there is no such consumer in this repository.

  **`@endora-commerce/admin-kit` — `resolveIcon` answers for both new names.** `ICON_MAP` gains
  `Building2` and `Store`; the function's signature is unchanged and every existing name resolves
  exactly as before.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-customers`, `@endora-commerce/mod-organizations` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-sales-channels` ship new i18n keys, and `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n` loses
  six.** `nav.customers.label`, `nav.customersOnline.label`, `nav.organizations.label`,
  `nav.salesChannels.label` and the two new actions' `label`/`description` pairs are in the three
  modules' own `i18n/{en,pl}.json`; `appShell.nav.customers`, `appShell.nav.customersOnline`,
  `appShell.nav.organizations`, `appShell.nav.salesChannels`,
  `appShell.palette.sub.customerAccounts` and `appShell.palette.sub.storefrontChannels` are removed
  from the shared bundle in both shipped languages, nothing rendering them any more. **A consumer
  resolving one of those six keys out of the `core` namespace will get a raw key**; each has a
  module-namespaced replacement above.

  **`organizations` and `sales_channels` declare a new palette action each.**
  `open-organizations` (`/organizations`, `customers:read`) and `open-sales-channels`
  (`/sales-channels`, `sales_channels:read`) replace hand-written rows in the admin's own palette
  table — copies the server was never asked about, which went on advertising the screens whatever
  the effective enabled-set said. One narrowing comes with `open-organizations`:
  `ModuleActionSchema.requiredPermission` is a single string, so it names `customers:read` and a
  role holding only `customers:manage` loses the palette entry while keeping the sidebar one.

- e637f56: Seven more modules become workspace packages (feature 080, T040b batch four):
  `assets_library`, `carts`, `custom_fields`, `customers`, `email`, `invoices` and
  `settings`. Each ships `dist` and resolves through its own `exports` map — the
  root for its manifest, `./backend` for `registerModule` plus the `entities`
  array, `./migrations` for its migration classes where it owns any — exactly as
  the forty-three packages before them.

  Three things a consumer of one of these packages should know.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-carts`, `@endora-commerce/mod-custom-fields` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-invoices` publish a `./ports` subpath.** It is type-only:
  `tsc` emits `export {};`, and it is where a consumer names
  `CartPlacementApplyPort`, `CustomFieldDefinitionApplyApi` and
  `InvoicePlacementApplyPort` instead of reaching into the owner's directory.

  ```ts
  import type { CartPlacementApplyPort } from '@endora-commerce/mod-carts/ports';
  ```

  The implementations stay behind their container names
  (`cartPlacementApplyPort`, `customFieldDefinitionApplyApi`,
  `invoicePlacementApplyPort`) and are resolved with `lazyPort`, never through
  this subpath.

  **`@endora-commerce/mod-settings` declares `entities` as an empty array.** The
  module owns no table — the settings store is the platform's — and the empty
  array is the statement, because the host reads a _missing_ export as `[]` and a
  forgotten one would be indistinguishable from an honest none.

  **No entity class is exported by name from any of the seven**, `import type`
  included (D-168). A consumer that must construct one takes it off the published
  `entities` array by name; `Cart`, `Invoice` and the rest are deliberately not
  importable.

### Patch Changes

- 3786732: Error-code ownership: the rest of Tier A is declared by the modules that own its nouns.

  `manifest.errorCodes` gains six codes on `@endora-commerce/mod-prompt-actions`
  (`ASSISTANT_*`, `PROMPT_*`), five on `@endora-commerce/mod-custom-fields` (`CUSTOM_FIELD_*`),
  two on `@endora-commerce/mod-customers` (`CUSTOMER_ADDRESS_NOT_FOUND`,
  `REGISTRATION_REQUIRES_ORGANIZATION`), two on `@endora-commerce/mod-shopping-lists`
  (`SHOPPING_LIST_*`), one on `@endora-commerce/mod-price-lists` (`PRICE_LIST_NOT_FOUND`) and one
  on `@endora-commerce/mod-transactional-emails` (`TRANSACTIONAL_EMAIL_NOT_DEACTIVATABLE`);
  `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n` drops the same seventeen from its own declaration, which is what
  decides where the error envelope looks for a sentence (D-129's remaining sweep, MR 3 of eight;
  D-121 tiers T1 and T2; `specs/090-module-owned-error-codes/d129-sweep.md`).

  For a consumer this changes which bundle answers for those codes. No wire shape moves —
  `error.code` is unchanged — and no sentence is relocated: none of the seventeen had a
  translation in `en` or `pl` in any bundle. Writing one of those sentences is now a change to the
  owning module's own `i18n/{en,pl}.json` rather than to the platform's.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-shopping-lists` gains an `i18n` bundle it never had, declared as
  `i18n: { bundlesDir: 'i18n' }` and shipped in `files`. It holds the two `SHOPPING_LIST_*`
  sentences in both languages, which is an operator- and buyer-visible improvement: a Polish
  reader refused a delete of the default or the last shopping list now reads Polish prose instead
  of the English the raise site carries.

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.

- 764b379: **`customerFilterCond`'s `allowed-set` arm stops returning `{}`, and the function takes an
  argument.**

  `customerFilterCond()` is now `customerFilterCond(organizationColumn: CustomerOrganizationColumn)`,
  where `CustomerOrganizationColumn` is `'present' | 'absent'` — both exported from
  `@endora-commerce/platform/tenancy`'s `filters` module. Any direct caller must pass one:

  ```ts
  // before
  const where = customerFilterCond();
  // after — `'present'` iff the entity you are filtering carries `organizationId`
  const where = customerFilterCond('absent');
  ```

  `@CustomerScoped()` itself is source-compatible and takes no new argument. It derives the answer
  per query from the ORM's discovered metadata, so an entity that gains an `organizationId` column
  starts being filtered on it with no further change.

  **The behaviour change is confined to the `allowed-set` mode** — the mode a scoped
  (assignment-limited) administrator resolves to. It previously contributed **no predicate at all**
  to any `@CustomerScoped` entity, so such an entity behaved as if it were `@GlobalEntity` for that
  actor. It now contributes `{ organizationId: { $in: allowed } }` when the entity carries the
  column, and a predicate that matches nothing when it does not. `all`, `system` and `single-org`
  are unchanged, and a buyer resolves `single-org`.

  A surface that has already established the caller's authority by other means and reads a
  `@CustomerScoped` entity with no organization column will now read nothing under a scoped
  administrator. Cross that deliberately with `withSystemScope(reason, fn)` after the check that
  establishes the authority; do not catch.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-quick-order`'s `registerQuickOrderAdminRoutes` takes a new required dep,
  `customerAccounts: CustomerAccountReadPort`. It is the tenant boundary of the admin build route:
  `onBehalfOf` names the customer account and organization the built Cart or Quote Request is
  written to, and it arrives in the request body, where no read filter can reach it.
