### Patch Changes

- 32fdf20: The `LICENSE` file in each package now names the copyright holder as Endora sp. z o.o.

  The MIT licence text is unchanged; only its copyright line moves from `Copyright (c) 2026 Endora`
  to `Copyright (c) 2026 Endora sp. z o.o.`, the registered legal entity. Nothing a package exports,
  declares or depends on changes. `@endora-commerce/contracts` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-invoice-ledger` also carry a one-sentence rewording in an already-published
  `CHANGELOG.md` entry, with no change to what that entry says about the code.

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- 8f61a6b: Every published package now ships its own `LICENSE` and `README.md`.

  npm force-includes a file named `LICENSE` into the tarball exactly as it does `README.md`,
  whatever `files` says, so the text has to be in the package directory and not only at the
  repository root — `LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md` states that rule and, until this release, no package
  obeyed it. Measured on `master`: **0** of the 82 publishable packages carried a `LICENSE` and
  **14** carried a `README.md`, so every tarball shipped without licence text and 68 registry
  pages would have rendered empty.

  Both files are **generated**, by `pnpm --filter backend run manifests:generate`, and refused
  when stale by `manifests:check` in the `quality` job:
  - the `LICENSE` is the repository's root `LICENSE`, copied verbatim — the same single source
    the `license: MIT` field is already rendered from. A package that declares a licence of its
    own in the `SEE LICENSE IN <file>` form is skipped and keeps the file it names.
  - the `README.md` is rendered from what the package's own manifest declares: its description,
    its module id where it has one, every published subpath with what that layer holds, its peer
    dependencies with the optional ones marked, the locales its `i18n/` carries and what the
    tarball ships. A `README.md` **without** the generated marker on its first line is a human's
    and is never rewritten — the fourteen that existed are untouched.

  Five module packages also get their npm description back. `@endora-commerce/mod-blog`,
  `mod-credit-limits`, `mod-dhl-parcel`, `mod-google-analytics` and `mod-quote-requests` carried
  the note written when they were moved out of `backend/src/modules` — _"the first module to
  leave backend/src/modules … the manifest id stays identity of record"_ — as the sentence a
  registry shows under the package name. Each now carries the sentence its own module manifest
  declares, which is where `descriptionFor` seeds one from in the first place.

  No API changes, no new dependency, no behaviour change: what moves is what the tarball carries
  and what a package page says.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 0eeb9b5: Require Node >= 22.18.0.

  The previous floor was 22.17.0, which MikroORM 7 sets. 22.18.0 is the first release that
  strips TypeScript types without a flag, and that is what loads a deployment's overlay module:
  in a scaffolded instance `apps/` is outside every compiled member, so the unit the platform
  `import()`s is the client's own `.ts`. On 22.17.x that import throws
  `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION` and the process dies before it listens. Emitting a `.js` beside
  the client's source was measured and refused — the overlay loader resolves `.js` before `.ts`
  while the divergence derivation admits both, so the sibling doubles every seam site in the
  report.

  Derived by probing 22.17.0, 22.17.1, 22.18.0 and 22.19.0 against a `.ts` module imported with
  no flag; 22.18.0 is the lowest that loads it.

  If you run 22.17.x, upgrade to 22.18 or later. Nothing else in these packages changed.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 3ad96d8: Ten new packages: the first **batch** of modules to leave `backend/src/modules/`
  (feature 080, T040b). Five moved one at a time before them; these ten move together, and
  the properties below are the same ten times over.

  **One changeset, not ten, and that is a judgement rather than a shortcut.** A changeset is
  written for the consumer of a package, and for a package that did not exist a moment ago
  there is no upgrader to instruct — every one of the ten says the same thing, _"this package
  now exists, here are its subpaths, and here is what it deliberately does not export"_. Ten
  files carrying one rationale would be nine copies of a derived fact. What genuinely differs
  per package is its layer inventory, and that is the table below.

  Every subpath is compiled output (D-164); none has a root wildcard; each package's `.` is
  its `manifest.ts`, where the generated manifest index reads the module's identity, its
  `dependencies`, its permission codes, its command-palette actions, its settings and its
  activation control.

  | Package                                | Subpaths                         | Entities                          | Migrations | Ships          |
  | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------- |
  | `@endora-commerce/mod-health-checks`   | `.`, `./backend`                 | —                                 | —          | `dist`         |
  | `@endora-commerce/mod-audit-logs`      | `.`, `./backend`                 | —                                 | —          | `dist`         |
  | `@endora-commerce/mod-addresses`       | `.`, `./backend`                 | `Address`                         | —          | `dist`         |
  | `@endora-commerce/mod-currencies`      | `.`, `./backend`                 | `Currency`                        | —          | `dist`         |
  | `@endora-commerce/mod-languages`       | `.`, `./backend`, `./migrations` | `Language`                        | 1          | `dist`         |
  | `@endora-commerce/mod-seo`             | `.`, `./backend`, `./migrations` | `SeoMetaOverride`, `SitemapCache` | 1          | `dist`         |
  | `@endora-commerce/mod-analytics`       | `.`, `./backend`, `./migrations` | `AnalyticsEvent`                  | 1          | `dist`         |
  | `@endora-commerce/mod-import-export`   | `.`, `./backend`                 | —                                 | —          | `dist`, `i18n` |
  | `@endora-commerce/mod-shipments`       | `.`, `./backend`, `./migrations` | `Shipment`                        | 2          | `dist`         |
  | `@endora-commerce/mod-payment-methods` | `.`, `./backend`, `./migrations` | `PaymentMethod`                   | 2          | `dist`, `i18n` |

  **`./backend` publishes `registerModule(ctx)` and an `entities` array, and no entity class by
  name** (D-168). The classes in that column are imported to build the array and are exported
  under no name, so `import type { PaymentMethod } from '@endora-commerce/mod-payment-methods/backend'`
  does not compile in a consumer's tree, whoever the consumer is. A foreign key still works —
  `shipments.order_id -> orders.id` is between two column names and needs the table, never the
  owner's class.

  **Three of the ten own no table, and say so with an empty array rather than by omission.**
  `health-checks`, `audit-logs` and `import-export` export `entities: readonly never[] = []`.
  The distinction is not cosmetic: the platform's package loader answers a _missing_ export with
  `[]`, so "this module has no table" and "somebody forgot the array" would otherwise arrive as
  one silence, whose only symptom is a query against a table nobody created.

  **`./migrations` publishes a `migrations` array plus each class by name.** The asymmetry with
  `./backend` is deliberate — `mikro_orm_migrations` persists the class name, so it is a string
  every already-migrated database holds, while an entity class name is contract to nobody.

  **Two behavioural removals, both in `./backend`, both affecting no caller in this repository.**
  `@endora-commerce/mod-currencies/backend` no longer re-exports `CURRENCY_CHANGED_EVENT` and
  `@endora-commerce/mod-languages/backend` no longer re-exports `LANGUAGE_CHANGED_EVENT`. Both
  constants live in `@endora-commerce/contracts` and have since feature 075's Phase P; the
  re-exports were that phase's compatibility shim, kept for consumers that turned out not to
  exist. Import them from `@endora-commerce/contracts`, which is where the one and only
  `dictionaries` consumer already reads them.

  ```ts
  // before — from the module barrel
  import { CURRENCY_CHANGED_EVENT } from '@endora-commerce/mod-currencies/backend';
  // after — from the contracts package, where the constant is declared
  import { CURRENCY_CHANGED_EVENT } from '@endora-commerce/contracts';
  ```

### Patch Changes

- 3b07abc: Error-code ownership: Tier B's four remaining modules declare the codes they own, each shipping its
  first i18n bundle.

  `manifest.errorCodes` gains five codes on `@endora-commerce/mod-credit-limits`
  (`ACTIVE_RESERVATIONS_EXIST`, `ADJUSTMENT_BELOW_ACTIVE`, `CREDIT_LIMIT_ALREADY_GRANTED`,
  `CREDIT_LIMIT_NOT_GRANTED`, `LIMIT_INSUFFICIENT`), three on `@endora-commerce/mod-api-keys`
  (`API_KEY_CHANNEL_MISMATCH`, `API_KEY_NOT_BOUND`, `API_KEY_OUT_OF_SCOPE`), two on
  `@endora-commerce/mod-addresses` (`ADDRESS_IN_USE`, `ADDRESS_NOT_OWNED`) and one on
  `@endora-commerce/mod-webhooks` (`WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_NOT_REPLAYABLE`); `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`
  drops the same eleven from its own declaration, which is what decides where the error envelope
  looks for a sentence (D-129's remaining sweep, MR 5 of eight; D-121 tier T1 throughout; D-186 §2
  and §3 in `specs/080-f4-real-scope/rulings.md`;
  `specs/090-module-owned-error-codes/d129-sweep.md`).

  All four declare an error code for the first time, and all four gain an `i18n` bundle they never
  had, declared as `i18n: { bundlesDir: 'i18n' }` and shipped in `files`. No wire shape moves:
  `error.code` is unchanged for all eleven.

  **Nine sentences are deleted from `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`'s bundle, and this is
  operator-visible.** Each was the error code rewritten twice — `"Limit Insufficient."` in `en` and
  `"Błąd: limit insufficient."` in `pl` — which D-186 §2 refuses to carry into a module's own bundle,
  where it would read as that module's answer rather than as an unwritten sentence. Six of the nine
  are replaced by real prose in both languages in the receiving module's own bundle:
  - `errors.ADJUSTMENT_BELOW_ACTIVE`, `errors.CREDIT_LIMIT_ALREADY_GRANTED`,
    `errors.CREDIT_LIMIT_NOT_GRANTED` and `errors.LIMIT_INSUFFICIENT` in
    `@endora-commerce/mod-credit-limits`
  - `errors.ADDRESS_NOT_OWNED` in `@endora-commerce/mod-addresses`
  - `errors.WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_NOT_REPLAYABLE` in `@endora-commerce/mod-webhooks`

  The other three keep no sentence. `ACTIVE_RESERVATIONS_EXIST` and `ADDRESS_IN_USE` are raised by
  nothing in the platform, so there was no refusal to describe. `API_KEY_OUT_OF_SCOPE` is raised, and
  is still not rewritten: its reader is an integration rather than a person, and the raise names the
  scope the key is missing (`API key lacks the required scope: <scope>.`) — the envelope substitutes
  the message wholesale and that raise carries no `details`, so a fixed sentence would take
  information away from the only audience that meets it. A consumer that reads those three keys out
  of `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`'s bundle directly will no longer find them.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-api-keys` therefore ships a bundle that installs **zero** entries, which is a
  state no module in this platform has been in before. `loadModuleBundles` answers
  `{"byLanguage":{}}` for it and the boot reconciler counts it as installed.

  `API_KEY_CHANNEL_MISMATCH` is raised by the platform's sales-channel resolver and now takes its
  sentence from a switchable module's bundle (D-186 §3). The coupling is bounded: the raise needs an
  `api_key` actor, which only `@endora-commerce/mod-auth`'s request hook produces and only by calling
  `@endora-commerce/mod-api-keys`' gated `apiKeyResolver`, so with the module absent the code cannot
  be produced at all.

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.
