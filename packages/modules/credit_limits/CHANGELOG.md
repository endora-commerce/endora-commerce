# @endora-commerce/mod-credit-limits

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- e27bf6c: Every package that ships scannable UI now publishes its own Tailwind `@source`
  declarations at a new `./tailwind.css` subpath.

  A host compiling this package's utility classes no longer has to know where the
  package's sources are. Import the subpath from the stylesheet that builds your
  admin, and the package names its own layers:

  ```css
  @import 'tailwindcss';
  @import '@endora-commerce/mod-blog/tailwind.css';
  ```

  `@source` resolves relative to the stylesheet that declares it, so the paths hold
  wherever the package is installed. The file is generated from the package's layer
  inventory, ships in the tarball beside `package.json`, and its `dist` line is the one
  that matters to you — the `src` line beside it is inert in a published package and
  exists so that a checkout of this repository keeps scanning source in `dev`.

  **Nothing is removed or renamed**: every existing subpath resolves exactly as before.
  What is new is the obligation on the _host_ side, and it is a build error rather than a
  silent one. Before this, a host reached these packages with a glob over the monorepo
  (`@source "../../packages/**"`), which named a directory no installed tree has —
  and Tailwind reports nothing at all about a source that matches nothing, so such a host
  built green and rendered every screen unstyled. A host that now names a package that is
  not installed gets `Can't resolve`, and one whose tarball omits the file gets
  `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`.

  `@endora-commerce/cms-components` deliberately does **not** publish this subpath. It
  ships a finished, prefixed stylesheet at `./styles.css` and must not also be scanned by
  its host.

### Patch Changes

- 6e037cd: The module declares `demo: false` — a decision recorded rather than a field filled in.

  The demo shop does have a granted credit limit and it is not this module's demo data: a grant's
  whole content is a reference to an `organizations` row, so it is two modules' rows in one
  statement and belongs to whoever owns the instance. It is a step of that composition, guarded on
  both modules, and this module does not declare `organizations` — `demo` may not become a way of
  acquiring a dependency.

  Absent and `false` are different states, so this changes no behaviour: it says the module owes
  nothing rather than leaving it undecided.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 196fbfa: Six modules ship their admin surfaces, and the delivery-methods list becomes a zone its
  carriers contribute to.

  **New `./admin` subpath on six packages.** `@endora-commerce/mod-seo`,
  `mod-taxes`, `mod-credit-limits`, `mod-delivery-methods`, `mod-megamenu` and `mod-returns`
  each export `contributions` — an `AdminContributions` object — from
  `@endora-commerce/mod-<id>/admin`. Every component is a dynamic-import factory, so a
  consumer's bundler emits one chunk per screen. The routes are unchanged: `/seo`, `/taxes`,
  `/credit-limits`, `/delivery-methods`, `/megamenu` plus `/megamenu/:id`, and `/returns`
  plus its four sub-screens.

  Three things a consumer has to know about that half:
  - **The subpath needs a build.** `./admin` resolves at `dist/admin/index.js`, emitted by
    each package's new `tsconfig.ui.json`; a checkout that has not run
    `pnpm run build:packages` cannot resolve it.
  - **`@endora-commerce/admin-kit` and `react` become peer dependencies of all six.** The kit
    is where every screen's design-system import resolves, and `react` is peered rather than
    depended on so the application resolves one copy.
  - **Each package now ships an `i18n/` bundle carrying its own `nav.*.label`.** The sidebar
    label is module-relative — `nav.seo.label`, `nav.taxes.label`, `nav.creditLimits.label`,
    `nav.deliveryMethods.label`, `nav.megamenu.label`, `nav.returns.label` — resolved in the
    module's own namespace instead of the shared `core` one.

  **New in `@endora-commerce/contracts`:**
  - `AdminZoneNameSchema` gains `'delivery_method.list.integrations'`, the first member whose
    host is not the product editor, with `DeliveryMethodIntegrationsZoneProps` (empty: the
    host renders one card per shipping integration and has no identifier to name one by) and
    its `AdminZonePropsMap` entry.
  - `KnownIconNameSchema` gains `'Newspaper'`, which `megamenu`'s sidebar entry names now
    that it declares its own row rather than importing the glyph.

  **New in `@endora-commerce/admin-kit`:** `DeliveryMethodIntegrationsZoneProps` is re-exported
  from `./contributions`, and `resolveIcon('Newspaper')` answers.

  **`mod-dhl-parcel` and `mod-inpost` each gain a zone contribution**, on the `./admin`
  subpath they already had:

  ```ts
  zoneComponent(
    'delivery_method.list.integrations',
    () => import('./zones/DeliveryMethodIntegrationCard.js'),
    {
      weight: 100,
      requiredPermission: 'dhl_parcel:read',
    },
  );
  ```

  `delivery_methods` used to render both cards itself, with each carrier's title, description,
  route and permission code written into its own file. A third carrier now needs no edit to a
  file its author does not own, and the presence gate, the permission gate and the ordering are
  the zone renderer's.

  Nothing is removed and no existing export changes shape, so a consumer of any package's
  `./backend`, `./migrations` or root subpath is unaffected.

- a80e2bb: Publish `CreditLimitReadPort` — the membership read on `credit_limits`' surface,
  on the `creditLimitReadPort` container.

  `organizationsWithLimit(organizationIds: readonly string[]): Promise<string[]>`
  answers which of the given organisations hold a credit-limit row, in no
  particular order. The caller supplies an ancestor chain and decides which hit is
  nearest.

  New surface only — nothing is removed and no existing call changes. Consumers on
  an older version keep compiling; a consumer that wants the port resolves it with
  `lazyPort<CreditLimitReadPort>(ctx, 'creditLimitReadPort')` and declares the edge
  in its manifest.

  Two properties of the implementation are contract rather than detail, and both
  are stated on the interface. The read crosses organisation scope deliberately —
  the holder is by definition an ancestor outside the caller's tenant filter, so a
  provider that let `@OrgScoped` narrow it would answer the empty set for every
  descendant. And the answer is plain ids: a `CreditLimit` handed across this seam
  would be a managed entity the consumer could mutate and flush outside the
  transaction that loaded it.

  It replaces a raw `select "organization_id" from "credit_limits" where
"organization_id" in (…)` that `organizations` ran against this module's table
  (feature 077, D-87). That statement named no import specifier, so the boundary it
  crossed compiled and returned rows whatever state this module was in; the port is
  gated, so an absent owner now refuses instead of reporting an empty chain, which
  downstream reads as "no limit applies".

- ed34cac: New package: the Credit Limits module, the fourth to leave `backend/src/modules/`
  (feature 080, T040b) — and the first to publish a port interface.

  Four subpaths, no root wildcard, every one of them compiled output (D-164):
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-credit-limits` — the manifest. Isomorphic,
    `@endora-commerce/contracts` its only import, and where the generated manifest index reads
    the module's identity, its `dependencies` (`organizations`, `auth`, `orders`), its one
    setting and its activation control (`credit_limits.enabled`) from.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-credit-limits/backend` — `registerModule(ctx)` and the `entities`
    array the host's ORM registry spreads. **No entity class is exported by name** (D-168):
    `CreditLimit`, `CreditLimitReservation` and `CreditLimitReturnTopup` are imported to build
    that array and nothing else, so `import type { CreditLimitReservation } from
'@endora-commerce/mod-credit-limits/backend'` does not compile in a consumer's tree,
    whoever the consumer is.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-credit-limits/migrations` — the `migrations` array the platform's
    package loader reads, plus the four migration classes by name for the host's migration
    registry.
  - `@endora-commerce/mod-credit-limits/ports` — **the first real `./ports` subpath**
    (layout contract R8, D-169), publishing the interface `CreditLimitPort`. Type-only: the
    emitted module is `export {};`, which is what makes the subpath resolvable for a consumer
    whose toolchain does not elide the import, and what makes it _contract surface_ under
    D-171. The implementation stays in the package's `src/backend/services/` and is reached
    through the container name `creditLimitService`, never through this subpath.

  `@endora-commerce/platform` is a `peerDependency` (D-160.2), and so are
  `@endora-commerce/contracts`, `@mikro-orm/{core,migrations,postgresql}` and `fastify`. This
  package takes no `zod` peer — it names no Zod type of its own, only schemas
  `@endora-commerce/contracts` already exports.

  The manifest id stays `credit_limits` — identity of record for the lifecycle registry, the
  settings store, the `credit_limits:manage` permission code and the ownership of its four
  migrations (D-142). The npm name is only how npm keeps names unique.

  **What `./ports` is for, since this package is the first to answer it.** T050 shipped the
  subpath and measured that nothing in the tree qualified for it yet: `quote_requests` publishes
  two genuinely real ports and both are contract DTOs end to end, so both belong in
  `@endora-commerce/contracts`. The qualifying test is not _"is this a real published port"_ but
  _"does this signature stop the interface living in `packages/contracts`"_ — and
  `CreditLimitPort.reserve` takes the caller's MikroORM `EntityManager`, which `admin` and
  `storefront` both compile `contracts` and so cannot. The `EntityManager` is a **required
  method parameter**, never an optional context field: the optional spelling lets a caller hand
  a transaction to a handler that ignores it and receive a silently non-atomic write.

  For a consumer that means one specifier and no other change:

  ```ts
  import type { CreditLimitPort } from '@endora-commerce/mod-credit-limits/ports';

  const creditLimit = lazyPort<CreditLimitPort>(ctx, 'creditLimitService');
  await creditLimit.reserve({ organizationId, orderId, amount, currency, tx });
  ```

  `reserve` holds a `PESSIMISTIC_WRITE` on the organization's credit row — or its owning
  ancestor's — for the length of the caller's transaction, and
  `credit_limit_reservations_order_fk` (`on delete restrict`) is what says so in the schema. A
  foreign key needs the **table** and never the owner's class (D-169), so that constraint stands
  across the package boundary untouched, exactly as `mod-blog`'s three cross-module ones do.

### Patch Changes

- 3b07abc: Error-code ownership: Tier B's four remaining modules declare the codes they own, each shipping its
  first i18n bundle.

  `manifest.errorCodes` gains five codes on `@endora-commerce/mod-credit-limits`
  (`ACTIVE_RESERVATIONS_EXIST`, `ADJUSTMENT_BELOW_ACTIVE`, `CREDIT_LIMIT_ALREADY_GRANTED`,
  `CREDIT_LIMIT_NOT_GRANTED`, `LIMIT_INSUFFICIENT`), three on `@endora-commerce/mod-api-keys`
  (`API_KEY_CHANNEL_MISMATCH`, `API_KEY_NOT_BOUND`, `API_KEY_OUT_OF_SCOPE`), two on
  `@endora-commerce/mod-addresses` (`ADDRESS_IN_USE`, `ADDRESS_NOT_OWNED`) and one on
  `@endora-commerce/mod-webhooks` (`WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_NOT_REPLAYABLE`); `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`
  drops the same eleven from its own declaration, which is what decides where the error envelope
  looks for a sentence (D-129's remaining sweep, MR 5 of eight; D-121 tier T1 throughout; D-186 §2
  and §3 in `specs/080-f4-real-scope/rulings.md`;
  `specs/090-module-owned-error-codes/d129-sweep.md`).

  All four declare an error code for the first time, and all four gain an `i18n` bundle they never
  had, declared as `i18n: { bundlesDir: 'i18n' }` and shipped in `files`. No wire shape moves:
  `error.code` is unchanged for all eleven.

  **Nine sentences are deleted from `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`'s bundle, and this is
  operator-visible.** Each was the error code rewritten twice — `"Limit Insufficient."` in `en` and
  `"Błąd: limit insufficient."` in `pl` — which D-186 §2 refuses to carry into a module's own bundle,
  where it would read as that module's answer rather than as an unwritten sentence. Six of the nine
  are replaced by real prose in both languages in the receiving module's own bundle:
  - `errors.ADJUSTMENT_BELOW_ACTIVE`, `errors.CREDIT_LIMIT_ALREADY_GRANTED`,
    `errors.CREDIT_LIMIT_NOT_GRANTED` and `errors.LIMIT_INSUFFICIENT` in
    `@endora-commerce/mod-credit-limits`
  - `errors.ADDRESS_NOT_OWNED` in `@endora-commerce/mod-addresses`
  - `errors.WEBHOOK_DELIVERY_NOT_REPLAYABLE` in `@endora-commerce/mod-webhooks`

  The other three keep no sentence. `ACTIVE_RESERVATIONS_EXIST` and `ADDRESS_IN_USE` are raised by
  nothing in the platform, so there was no refusal to describe. `API_KEY_OUT_OF_SCOPE` is raised, and
  is still not rewritten: its reader is an integration rather than a person, and the raise names the
  scope the key is missing (`API key lacks the required scope: <scope>.`) — the envelope substitutes
  the message wholesale and that raise carries no `details`, so a fixed sentence would take
  information away from the only audience that meets it. A consumer that reads those three keys out
  of `@endora-commerce/mod-i18n`'s bundle directly will no longer find them.

  `@endora-commerce/mod-api-keys` therefore ships a bundle that installs **zero** entries, which is a
  state no module in this platform has been in before. `loadModuleBundles` answers
  `{"byLanguage":{}}` for it and the boot reconciler counts it as installed.

  `API_KEY_CHANNEL_MISMATCH` is raised by the platform's sales-channel resolver and now takes its
  sentence from a switchable module's bundle (D-186 §3). The coupling is bounded: the raise needs an
  `api_key` actor, which only `@endora-commerce/mod-auth`'s request hook produces and only by calling
  `@endora-commerce/mod-api-keys`' gated `apiKeyResolver`, so with the module absent the code cannot
  be produced at all.

- 73da94f: Each of these packages now carries the unit tests that cover its own sources,
  and a `vitest` configuration and `test` script to run them.

  For a consumer the manifest is what changed: `vitest` joins `peerDependencies`
  and `devDependencies`, and `scripts.test` is `vitest run`. Both are rendered by
  `manifests:generate` from the package's own layer inventory, so they follow the
  test files rather than being declared by hand. Nothing exported moves: the test
  files are excluded from `tsconfig.build.json`'s emit and from the `files` list,
  so the published tarball is byte-identical apart from the manifest.

  Running them needs nothing but the package — that is the property that decided
  which files moved. A test that composes a backend server, reads a live Postgres
  or Redis, or names anything under `backend/` stayed where it was.
